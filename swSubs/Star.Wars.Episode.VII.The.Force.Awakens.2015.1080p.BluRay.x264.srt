00:01:53,061 --> 00:01:57,025
JAKKU *

3
00:02:45,104 --> 00:02:47,722
Oh, no.
Time to go.

4
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,346
This will begin to make things right.

5
00:02:59,764 --> 00:03:02,848
I've traveled too far and seen too much

6
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,936
to ignore the despair in the galaxy.

7
00:03:05,937 --> 00:03:10,274
Without the Jedi, there can be
no balance in the Force.

8
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:13,276
Well, because of you,
now we have a chance.

9
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,486
The General's been after this
for a long time.

10
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:16,989
Oh, the General?

11
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,680
To me, she is royalty.

12
00:03:19,704 --> 00:03:21,789
Well, she certainly is that.

13
00:03:22,165 --> 00:03:27,328
I spotted 4 transport vessels and
it seems they are approaching this way.

14
00:03:27,353 --> 00:03:29,266
We got company.

15
00:03:41,223 --> 00:03:43,098
You have to hide.

16
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:45,016
You have to leave.

17
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:48,145
Go.

18
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,846
- Come on, BB-8, hurry!
- I am.

19
00:04:26,586 --> 00:04:28,728
I'm in position.

20
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:33,582
Please hurry.

21
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:36,485
<i>Blast that X-wing!
Over there! Over there!</i>

22
00:04:40,792 --> 00:04:43,869
- They are coming behind us.
- I see them!

23
00:05:14,528 --> 00:05:15,571
You take this.

24
00:05:15,596 --> 00:05:18,055
It's safer with you than it is with me.

25
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:21,197
You get as far away from here
as you can.

26
00:05:21,617 --> 00:05:23,273
- Do you hear me?
- I don't know...

27
00:05:23,298 --> 00:05:25,173
I'll come back for you.

28
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,437
It will be all right.

29
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,971
<i>Keep moving!</i>

30
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,475
<i>Stay here.</i>

31
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,750
<i>Look how old you've become.</i>

32
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:01,379
Something far worse
has happened to you.

33
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:04,048
<i>You know what I've come for.</i>

34
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,050
I know where you come from.

35
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:08,512
Before you called yourself Kylo Ren.

36
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:12,598
<i>The map to Skywalker.
We know you found it.</i>

37
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,144
<i>And now you're going
to give it to the First Order.</i>

38
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,687
The First Order rose from the dark side.

39
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:20,415
You did not.

40
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:23,860
<i>I'll show you the dark side.</i>

41
00:07:23,886 --> 00:07:25,637
You may try.

42
00:07:25,661 --> 00:07:30,165
But you cannot deny
the truth that is your family.

43
00:07:30,456 --> 00:07:32,288
<i>You're so right.</i>

44
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:08,404
So, who talks first?
You talk first? I talk first?

45
00:08:08,874 --> 00:08:10,658
<i>The old man gave it to you.</i>

46
00:08:10,684 --> 00:08:12,783
It's just very hard to
understand you with all the...

47
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:15,283
<i>- Search him.</i>
- ...apparatus.

48
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,834
<i>- Nothing, sir.</i>
<i>- Put him on board.</i>

49
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:29,834
<i>Sir, the villagers?</i>

50
00:08:31,334 --> 00:08:33,043
<i>Kill them all.</i>

51
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:35,984
<i>On my command.</i>

52
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:38,043
<i>Fire.</i>

53
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:40,770
Please, no!

54
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:11,051
<i>Nothing here.
Go ahead!</i>

55
00:09:13,985 --> 00:09:15,284
Huh?

56
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,759
All right.

57
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:54,260
All right!

58
00:10:19,567 --> 00:10:21,778
<i>FN-218</i>7.

59
00:10:21,802 --> 00:10:24,806
<i>Submit your blaster for inspection.</i>

60
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,897
Yes, Captain.

61
00:10:26,922 --> 00:10:30,133
<i>And who gave you permission
to remove that helmet?</i>

62
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,150
- I'm sorry, Captain.
<i>- Report to my division at once.</i>

63
00:13:12,495 --> 00:13:15,573
You, there.
Hurry up with the cleaning!

64
00:13:19,158 --> 00:13:22,534
What you brought
me today is worth...

65
00:13:22,536 --> 00:13:24,804
hmm...

66
00:13:25,456 --> 00:13:28,850
one quarter portion.

67
00:14:42,528 --> 00:14:45,080
*(AT-AT)

68
00:14:49,153 --> 00:14:52,115
Where are you taking me?!

69
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:53,837
Be quiet!

70
00:14:54,209 --> 00:14:56,403
I don't belong to you!

71
00:14:56,427 --> 00:14:58,537
You are mine now.

72
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,383
No!
Let me go!

73
00:15:04,408 --> 00:15:06,447
One more word and
you'll be scrap metal.

74
00:15:06,471 --> 00:15:08,038
You, let him go!

75
00:15:08,063 --> 00:15:09,668
- What?
- Huh?

76
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:12,524
Go away, it's mine.
Go away.

77
00:15:12,549 --> 00:15:13,969
Let him go, I say!

78
00:15:13,994 --> 00:15:16,412
- Mind you own business.
- Please help me.

79
00:15:16,437 --> 00:15:17,655
Oh, thank you.

80
00:15:17,681 --> 00:15:19,788
Hey!
I found him first!

81
00:15:19,812 --> 00:15:20,956
Get going!

82
00:15:20,982 --> 00:15:24,957
Blast my luck.
Come on, move it, move it.

83
00:15:24,982 --> 00:15:26,927
Get off that thing and
I'll show you how...

84
00:15:26,951 --> 00:15:28,522
Shh.

85
00:15:29,543 --> 00:15:32,932
That's just Teedo.
Wants you for parts.

86
00:15:32,957 --> 00:15:35,243
He has no respect for anyone.

87
00:15:35,268 --> 00:15:36,832
Oh.

88
00:15:38,254 --> 00:15:40,039
Your antenna's bent.

89
00:15:49,099 --> 00:15:50,437
Where do you come from?

90
00:15:50,461 --> 00:15:53,913
I'm not suppose to tell,
it's classified.

91
00:15:53,913 --> 00:15:55,434
- Classified, really?
- Yep.

92
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:57,705
Me too.
Big secret.

93
00:15:58,024 --> 00:16:01,277
Niima Outpost is that way.
Stay off Kelvin Ridge.

94
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:03,238
Keep away from
the Sinking Fields in the north.

95
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:05,356
You'll drown in the sand.

96
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:09,503
You are so very kind.
I would like to come with you.

97
00:16:09,894 --> 00:16:13,051
Don't follow me.
Town is that way.

98
00:16:13,076 --> 00:16:16,059
Oh.
Can't I stay with you?

99
00:16:16,085 --> 00:16:17,786
No!

100
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,489
I am scared.

101
00:16:28,735 --> 00:16:33,394
Yay! I knew you are a
kind hearted person.

102
00:16:33,419 --> 00:16:35,746
In the morning, you go.

103
00:16:36,827 --> 00:16:39,212
Thank you, again.

104
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,726
You're welcome.

105
00:16:53,746 --> 00:16:58,534
<i>I had no idea we had the best
pilot in the Resistance on board.</i>

106
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:01,727
<i>Comfortable?</i>

107
00:17:01,753 --> 00:17:03,453
Not really.

108
00:17:04,086 --> 00:17:06,077
<i>I'm impressed.</i>

109
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,505
<i>No one has been able to
get out of you...</i>

110
00:17:10,513 --> 00:17:13,891
<i>what you did with the map.</i>

111
00:17:13,892 --> 00:17:16,928
You might want to rethink
your technique.

112
00:17:31,701 --> 00:17:34,738
<i>Where is it?</i>

113
00:17:35,998 --> 00:17:37,707
The Resistance...

114
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,410
will not be intimidated by you.

115
00:17:43,881 --> 00:17:47,375
<i>Where... is it?</i>

116
00:17:56,643 --> 00:17:59,479
<i>It's in a droid. A BB unit.</i>

117
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:02,022
Well, then, if it's on Jakku,
we'll soon have it.

118
00:18:02,023 --> 00:18:04,392
<i>I leave that to you.</i>

119
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:08,613
Don't give up hope.
He still might show up.

120
00:18:08,614 --> 00:18:10,823
Whoever it is you're waiting for.

121
00:18:10,824 --> 00:18:12,983
Classified.

122
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:14,549
I know all about waiting.

123
00:18:14,575 --> 00:18:16,637
Mistress, you're waiting for someone too?

124
00:18:16,663 --> 00:18:18,748
For my family.

125
00:18:18,749 --> 00:18:22,201
They'll be back.
One day.

126
00:18:22,294 --> 00:18:23,994
Come on.

127
00:18:26,298 --> 00:18:30,167
<i>These five pieces are worth...</i>

128
00:18:30,301 --> 00:18:32,804
Let me see here... hmm...

129
00:18:32,805 --> 00:18:35,597
one half portion.

130
00:18:35,598 --> 00:18:37,218
Last week they were a half portion each.

131
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:39,587
What about the droid?

132
00:18:41,939 --> 00:18:43,105
What about him?

133
00:18:43,106 --> 00:18:45,974
I'll pay for him.

134
00:18:51,155 --> 00:18:53,136
Sixty portions.

135
00:18:53,162 --> 00:18:54,588
- Whoa.
- Wow.

136
00:18:54,614 --> 00:18:57,088
Look at all that.

137
00:19:05,461 --> 00:19:07,163
Actually...

138
00:19:08,464 --> 00:19:11,084
The droid's not for sale.

139
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:14,420
Come on.

140
00:19:18,016 --> 00:19:21,094
Follow the girl and get that droid.

141
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:26,391
<i>Ren wants the prisoner.</i>

142
00:19:35,075 --> 00:19:36,901
<i>Turn here.</i>

143
00:19:38,162 --> 00:19:39,244
<i>Listen carefully.</i>

144
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:41,580
<i>If you do exactly as I say,
I can get you out of here.</i>

145
00:19:41,582 --> 00:19:43,282
What?

146
00:19:43,834 --> 00:19:46,001
This is a rescue. I'm helping you escape.

147
00:19:46,002 --> 00:19:47,836
Can you fly a TIE fighter?

148
00:19:47,837 --> 00:19:49,005
You're with the Resistance?

149
00:19:49,006 --> 00:19:51,007
What? No, no, no. I'm breaking you out.

150
00:19:51,008 --> 00:19:53,710
- Can you fly a TIE fighter?
- I can fly anything.

151
00:19:53,759 --> 00:19:57,046
Why? Why are you helping me?

152
00:19:57,722 --> 00:20:00,133
Because it's the right thing to do.

153
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:01,517
You need a pilot.

154
00:20:01,518 --> 00:20:03,553
I need a pilot.

155
00:20:04,354 --> 00:20:05,770
We're gonna do this.

156
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:07,472
Yeah?

157
00:20:11,068 --> 00:20:13,362
<i>Okay. Stay calm. Stay calm.</i>

158
00:20:13,363 --> 00:20:16,566
- I am calm.
<i>- I'm talking to myself.</i>

159
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:20,068
<i>Not yet.</i>

160
00:20:21,246 --> 00:20:23,655
<i>Okay, go. This way.</i>

161
00:20:29,212 --> 00:20:31,380
I've always wanted to fly
one of these things.

162
00:20:31,381 --> 00:20:33,548
- Can you shoot?
- Blasters, I can.

163
00:20:33,549 --> 00:20:34,967
Okay, same principle.

164
00:20:34,968 --> 00:20:36,051
Use the toggle on the left...

165
00:20:36,052 --> 00:20:37,845
to switch between missiles,
cannons and mag pulse.

166
00:20:37,846 --> 00:20:39,680
Use the sight on the right to aim.

167
00:20:39,681 --> 00:20:42,174
- Triggers to fire.
- This is very complicated.

168
00:20:48,065 --> 00:20:49,848
I can fix this.

169
00:20:52,486 --> 00:20:55,070
We have an unsanctioned
departure from bay two.

170
00:20:55,072 --> 00:20:58,523
Alert General Hux.
And stop that fighter.

171
00:21:18,511 --> 00:21:20,296
Fourteen failed. Eighteen...

172
00:21:21,682 --> 00:21:23,465
I got it.

173
00:21:26,686 --> 00:21:28,930
This thing really moves.

174
00:21:32,817 --> 00:21:35,152
Alright. We gotta take out as many of
these cannons as we can...

175
00:21:35,153 --> 00:21:36,278
or we're not gonna get very far.

176
00:21:36,279 --> 00:21:37,926
- All right.
- I'm gonna get us in position.

177
00:21:37,951 --> 00:21:39,653
Just stay sharp.

178
00:21:41,993 --> 00:21:43,661
Up ahead! Up ahead! You see it?

179
00:21:43,662 --> 00:21:44,787
I got us dead center.

180
00:21:44,788 --> 00:21:46,614
- It's a clean shot.
- Okay, got it.

181
00:21:54,673 --> 00:21:56,173
- Yeah!
- Yes!

182
00:21:56,173 --> 00:21:57,340
Did you see that?

183
00:21:57,342 --> 00:21:59,669
- Did you see that?
- I saw it!

184
00:22:04,641 --> 00:22:05,849
Hey, what's your name?

185
00:22:05,851 --> 00:22:07,183
FN-2187.

186
00:22:07,184 --> 00:22:08,477
F... What?

187
00:22:08,478 --> 00:22:10,438
That's the only name
they ever gave me.

188
00:22:10,439 --> 00:22:12,981
Well, I ain't using it. F-N, huh?

189
00:22:12,982 --> 00:22:14,567
Finn.
I'm gonna call you Finn.

190
00:22:14,567 --> 00:22:16,277
- Is that all right?
- Finn.

191
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:18,028
Yeah. Finn, I like that.

192
00:22:18,029 --> 00:22:20,280
- I like that.
- I'm Poe. Poe Dameron.

193
00:22:20,281 --> 00:22:22,900
- Good to meet you, Poe.
- Good to meet you too, Finn.

194
00:22:25,787 --> 00:22:28,905
Sir, they've
taken out our turbolasers.

195
00:22:28,999 --> 00:22:30,708
Use the ventral cannons.

196
00:22:30,709 --> 00:22:32,710
Yes, sir. Bringing them online.

197
00:22:32,711 --> 00:22:35,503
<i>General Hux,
is it the Resistance pilot?</i>

198
00:22:35,505 --> 00:22:38,007
Yes, and he had help...

199
00:22:38,008 --> 00:22:40,084
from one of our own.

200
00:22:40,176 --> 00:22:41,509
We're checking the registers now...

201
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,511
to identify which stormtrooper it was.

202
00:22:43,512 --> 00:22:47,516
<i>The one from the village. FN-218</i>7.

203
00:22:47,517 --> 00:22:49,852
Sir, ventral cannons hot.

204
00:22:49,853 --> 00:22:51,554
Fire.

205
00:23:00,238 --> 00:23:01,989
One's coming toward you!
My right. Your left.

206
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:03,865
- Do you see it?
- Hold on.

207
00:23:03,866 --> 00:23:05,567
I see him!

208
00:23:08,246 --> 00:23:10,448
Nice shot!

209
00:23:16,087 --> 00:23:17,296
Where are we going?

210
00:23:17,297 --> 00:23:18,547
We're going back to Jakku.
That's where.

211
00:23:18,548 --> 00:23:20,173
No, no, no.
We can't go back to Jakku.

212
00:23:20,174 --> 00:23:21,480
We need to get out of this system.

213
00:23:21,506 --> 00:23:23,719
I gotta get my droid
before the First Order does.

214
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:25,054
- What, a droid?
- That's right.

215
00:23:25,055 --> 00:23:27,178
He's a BB unit, orange and
white. One of a kind.

216
00:23:27,202 --> 00:23:28,473
I don't care what color he is!

217
00:23:28,499 --> 00:23:30,366
- No droid can be that important.
- This one is, pal!

218
00:23:30,392 --> 00:23:32,326
We gotta get as far away from
the First Order as we can.

219
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:34,038
We go back to Jakku, we die.

220
00:23:34,064 --> 00:23:36,644
That droid has a map
that leads straight to Luke Skywalker.

221
00:23:36,669 --> 00:23:39,288
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

222
00:23:41,863 --> 00:23:45,074
<i>FN-218</i>7 <i>reported
to my division...</i>

223
00:23:45,075 --> 00:23:47,451
<i>was evaluated,
and sent to reconditioning.</i>

224
00:23:47,451 --> 00:23:49,787
No prior signs of nonconformity?

225
00:23:49,788 --> 00:23:51,788
<i>This was his first offense.</i>

226
00:23:51,789 --> 00:23:52,998
General!

227
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:54,458
- They've been hit.
- Destroyed?

228
00:23:54,459 --> 00:23:55,792
Disabled.

229
00:23:55,794 --> 00:23:57,294
They were headed back to Jakku.

230
00:23:57,295 --> 00:23:59,587
The fighter is projected to
crash in the Goazon badlands.

231
00:23:59,588 --> 00:24:01,382
They were going back for the droid.

232
00:24:01,383 --> 00:24:04,000
Send a squad to the wreckage.

233
00:24:25,656 --> 00:24:27,525
Poe!

234
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,153
Poe!

235
00:24:30,287 --> 00:24:32,028
Poe!

236
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,992
Poe! I got you.

237
00:24:38,461 --> 00:24:40,163
Poe!

238
00:24:46,302 --> 00:24:48,045
Poe!

239
00:26:11,555 --> 00:26:13,931
<i>Supreme Leader Snoke
was explicit.</i>

240
00:26:13,932 --> 00:26:16,432
Capture the droid if we can,
but destroy it if we must.

241
00:26:16,433 --> 00:26:18,352
<i>How capable
are your soldiers, General?</i>

242
00:26:18,353 --> 00:26:19,894
I won't have you question my methods.

243
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,016
<i>They're obviously skilled
at committing high treason.</i>

244
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:24,641
<i>Perhaps Leader Snoke should
consider using a clone army.</i>

245
00:26:24,665 --> 00:26:27,403
My men are exceptionally trained.
Programmed from birth.

246
00:26:27,403 --> 00:26:29,779
<i>Then they should have
no problem retrieving the droid.</i>

247
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:31,481
<i>Unharmed.</i>

248
00:26:31,866 --> 00:26:34,117
Careful, Ren, that your
personal interests...

249
00:26:34,118 --> 00:26:36,744
not interfere with orders
from Leader Snoke.

250
00:26:36,746 --> 00:26:39,248
<i>I want that map.</i>

251
00:26:39,249 --> 00:26:40,749
<i>For your sake...</i>

252
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:42,660
<i>I suggest you get it.</i>

253
00:26:48,549 --> 00:26:49,799
Water.
Water.

254
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,925
No water.

255
00:26:50,926 --> 00:26:53,128
- Water.
- No.

256
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,753
Is there water?

257
00:26:55,778 --> 00:26:57,938
Hey!
Watch where you're going!

258
00:27:21,032 --> 00:27:23,612
Hey, girl. I'm taking
your droid to Unkar Plutt.

259
00:27:23,636 --> 00:27:26,114
What?
Oi, get off him!

260
00:27:26,138 --> 00:27:27,502
What's happening?

261
00:27:30,807 --> 00:27:32,778
Mistress?

262
00:27:35,856 --> 00:27:37,365
Hey!

263
00:27:40,677 --> 00:27:41,973
Oh...

264
00:27:45,266 --> 00:27:46,494
Huh?

265
00:27:49,104 --> 00:27:53,006
Mistress, who were those people?

266
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:55,054
They work for Unkar.

267
00:27:55,078 --> 00:27:57,034
That guy that wanted you.

268
00:27:57,035 --> 00:27:59,017
He must have really wanted you.

269
00:27:59,381 --> 00:28:01,680
Mistress! That man is wearing
my master's jacket!

270
00:28:01,704 --> 00:28:02,893
Who?

271
00:28:02,917 --> 00:28:04,645
That man over there.

272
00:28:04,671 --> 00:28:07,830
- Him?
- Yes. He must have stolen it.

273
00:28:24,813 --> 00:28:28,580
- What's your hurry, thief?
- What? Thief?

274
00:28:28,605 --> 00:28:29,692
Ow!

275
00:28:29,692 --> 00:28:31,067
- Hey, what?
- The jacket.

276
00:28:31,068 --> 00:28:33,505
This droid says you stole it.

277
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:35,322
I've had a pretty
messed up day, all right?

278
00:28:35,323 --> 00:28:37,617
So I'd appreciate it...
if you stop accusing me of...

279
00:28:37,643 --> 00:28:40,068
- Ow! Stop it!
- Where'd you get it?

280
00:28:40,094 --> 00:28:42,260
It belongs to his master.

281
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,786
It belonged to Poe Dameron.
That was his name, right?

282
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,881
He was captured by the First Order.

283
00:28:52,882 --> 00:28:56,167
I helped him escape,
but our ship crashed.

284
00:28:58,596 --> 00:29:00,423
Poe didn't make it.

285
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:07,430
I tried to help him. I'm sorry.

286
00:29:14,903 --> 00:29:17,314
So you're with the Resistance?

287
00:29:21,243 --> 00:29:22,744
Obviously.

288
00:29:22,746 --> 00:29:24,121
Yes, I am.

289
00:29:24,122 --> 00:29:25,538
I'm with the Resistance, yeah.

290
00:29:25,539 --> 00:29:28,284
I am with the Resistance.

291
00:29:28,792 --> 00:29:31,912
I've never met
a Resistance fighter before.

292
00:29:32,756 --> 00:29:34,298
Well, this is what we look like.

293
00:29:34,298 --> 00:29:36,924
Some of us. Others look different.

294
00:29:36,925 --> 00:29:38,469
BB-8 says he's on a secret mission.

295
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,095
He has to get back to your base.

296
00:29:40,096 --> 00:29:42,431
Apparently, he has a map that
leads to Luke Skywalker...

297
00:29:42,432 --> 00:29:44,724
and everyone's after it.

298
00:29:44,726 --> 00:29:46,977
Luke Skywalker?

299
00:29:46,978 --> 00:29:48,384
I thought he was a myth.

300
00:29:48,410 --> 00:29:51,195
- Mistress, you better come and see this!
What?

301
00:29:53,981 --> 00:29:56,983
Yes. Yes.
The droid is over there.

302
00:29:58,781 --> 00:30:01,241
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

303
00:30:01,512 --> 00:30:03,381
Come on, BB-8!

304
00:30:06,122 --> 00:30:07,748
- Let go of me!
- Come on, we gotta move!

305
00:30:07,749 --> 00:30:10,534
I know how to run
without you holding my hand!

306
00:30:12,172 --> 00:30:14,296
BB-8, stay close!

307
00:30:14,297 --> 00:30:15,998
This way.

308
00:30:21,096 --> 00:30:23,005
<i>Call in the air strike.</i>

309
00:30:23,138 --> 00:30:25,382
Come on!

310
00:30:26,142 --> 00:30:27,476
They're shooting at both of us.

311
00:30:27,477 --> 00:30:29,478
Yeah. They saw you with me.
You're marked.

312
00:30:29,479 --> 00:30:30,979
- Well, thanks for that.
- Hey!

313
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:33,516
I'm not the one who chased
you down with a stick.

314
00:30:34,108 --> 00:30:35,692
Does anyone have
blasters around here?

315
00:30:35,692 --> 00:30:37,598
- Are you okay?
- Yes, but I think we better leave...

316
00:30:37,624 --> 00:30:38,865
Shhh. Shhh.
Shhh.

317
00:30:42,784 --> 00:30:45,212
Stop taking my hand!

318
00:31:00,509 --> 00:31:02,211
Hey.

319
00:31:04,806 --> 00:31:06,548
Are you okay?

320
00:31:07,851 --> 00:31:09,335
Yeah.

321
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:11,185
Follow me.

322
00:31:22,198 --> 00:31:23,531
- We can't outrun them!
- We might...

323
00:31:23,532 --> 00:31:24,907
in that quadjumper!

324
00:31:24,909 --> 00:31:26,367
Hey, we need a pilot!

325
00:31:26,368 --> 00:31:28,036
We've got one.

326
00:31:28,037 --> 00:31:29,704
You?

327
00:31:29,705 --> 00:31:31,748
Uh, what about that ship?

328
00:31:31,749 --> 00:31:33,909
That one's garbage!

329
00:31:38,568 --> 00:31:40,729
The garbage will do.

330
00:31:50,026 --> 00:31:51,458
Garbage?

331
00:31:56,065 --> 00:31:58,474
Gunner position is down there!

332
00:32:01,028 --> 00:32:02,778
You ever fly this thing?

333
00:32:02,779 --> 00:32:06,074
No! This ship hasn't flown in years.

334
00:32:06,075 --> 00:32:07,776
Great.

335
00:32:11,288 --> 00:32:13,123
Whoa.

336
00:32:13,124 --> 00:32:15,125
I can do this. I can do this.

337
00:32:15,125 --> 00:32:17,452
I can do this. I can do this.

338
00:32:37,941 --> 00:32:39,642
Hey!

339
00:32:43,278 --> 00:32:45,521
That's mine!

340
00:32:48,409 --> 00:32:50,117
Wait, stay low! Hey, stay low!

341
00:32:50,118 --> 00:32:51,286
- What?
<i>- Stay low!</i>

342
00:32:51,287 --> 00:32:52,871
It confuses their tracking.

343
00:32:52,872 --> 00:32:54,957
- BB-8, hold on!
- Why?

344
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:57,034
I'm going low!

345
00:33:14,978 --> 00:33:16,310
What are you doing back there?

346
00:33:16,311 --> 00:33:17,645
Are you ever gonna fire back?

347
00:33:17,646 --> 00:33:19,815
I'm working on it! Are the shields up?

348
00:33:19,816 --> 00:33:21,650
Not so easy without a co-pilot!

349
00:33:21,651 --> 00:33:24,228
Try sitting in this thing.

350
00:33:37,834 --> 00:33:39,334
We need cover, quick!

351
00:33:39,335 --> 00:33:40,711
We're about to get some!

352
00:33:40,711 --> 00:33:42,621
I hope.

353
00:33:57,285 --> 00:33:58,643
Whoa.

354
00:34:07,613 --> 00:34:09,815
Damn it!

355
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:22,577
Come on, come on!

356
00:34:24,713 --> 00:34:27,666
- Nice shot!
- I'm getting pretty good at this.

357
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,688
Uh, the cannon's stuck
in forward position.

358
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:45,059
I can't move it. You gotta lose him!

359
00:34:48,237 --> 00:34:51,440
- Get ready!
- Okay. For what?

360
00:35:04,545 --> 00:35:06,371
Are we really doing this?

361
00:35:15,097 --> 00:35:17,132
Oh, no.

362
00:35:37,869 --> 00:35:39,570
Whoo!

363
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:54,844
- Nice shooting.
- Now that was some flying.

364
00:35:54,846 --> 00:35:55,929
- Thanks.
- How did you do that?

365
00:35:55,929 --> 00:35:57,304
- I don't know.
- No one trained you?

366
00:35:57,306 --> 00:35:59,141
I've flown some ships, but
I've never left the planet.

367
00:35:59,141 --> 00:36:00,391
- Your last shot was dead-on.
- That was amazing.

368
00:36:00,393 --> 00:36:01,809
- You got him with one blast!
- You set me up for it.

369
00:36:01,811 --> 00:36:03,481
- It was perfect.
- That was pretty good.

370
00:36:03,505 --> 00:36:06,550
Mistress.
Can we trust this person?

371
00:36:06,576 --> 00:36:09,650
You're okay.
He's with the Resistance.

372
00:36:10,193 --> 00:36:12,521
He's gonna get you home.

373
00:36:12,947 --> 00:36:14,648
We both will.

374
00:36:19,786 --> 00:36:21,612
I don't know your name.

375
00:36:22,873 --> 00:36:25,117
Finn.
What's yours?

376
00:36:25,652 --> 00:36:27,644
I'm Rey.

377
00:36:31,548 --> 00:36:33,507
Rey...

378
00:36:33,509 --> 00:36:35,885
Help me with this.
Quick!

379
00:36:35,887 --> 00:36:38,141
Whoa, what's going on?

380
00:36:48,336 --> 00:36:49,773
Sir...

381
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:53,103
we were unable to acquire
the droid on Jakku.

382
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:59,400
It escaped capture aboard a
stolen Corellian YT model freighter.

383
00:37:00,244 --> 00:37:03,862
<i>The droid...
stole a freighter?</i>

384
00:37:03,887 --> 00:37:06,208
Not exactly, sir.

385
00:37:06,208 --> 00:37:07,909
It had help.

386
00:37:10,539 --> 00:37:12,047
We have no confirmation...

387
00:37:12,047 --> 00:37:15,655
but we believe FN-2187 may
have helped in the escape.

388
00:37:32,777 --> 00:37:34,478
<i>Anything else?</i>

389
00:37:36,655 --> 00:37:39,054
The two were accompanied by a girl.

390
00:37:43,496 --> 00:37:45,947
<i>What girl?</i>

391
00:37:47,958 --> 00:37:49,125
It's the motivator.

392
00:37:49,126 --> 00:37:50,710
Grab me a Harris wrench,
check in there.

393
00:37:50,710 --> 00:37:51,795
How bad is it?

394
00:37:51,795 --> 00:37:53,588
If we wanna live, not good.

395
00:37:53,588 --> 00:37:54,630
They're hunting for us now.

396
00:37:54,632 --> 00:37:55,923
We've gotta get out of this system!

397
00:37:55,949 --> 00:37:58,317
BB-8 said the location of the
Resistance base is "need to know".

398
00:37:58,342 --> 00:38:00,445
If I'm taking you there, I need to know!

399
00:38:00,471 --> 00:38:01,791
This?

400
00:38:02,722 --> 00:38:04,199
You gotta tell us
where your base is.

401
00:38:04,224 --> 00:38:06,974
- What? No.
- I don't speak that.

402
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,978
All right, between us...

403
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,139
I'm not with the Resistance, okay?

404
00:38:11,164 --> 00:38:13,108
I'm just trying to get away
from the First Order.

405
00:38:13,108 --> 00:38:14,699
But you tell us where the base is...

406
00:38:14,724 --> 00:38:17,190
I'll get you there first.
Deal?

407
00:38:17,215 --> 00:38:19,842
- Droid, please!
- Pilex driver, hurry.

408
00:38:19,867 --> 00:38:21,958
- So, where's your base?
- Go on, BB-8, tell her.

409
00:38:21,983 --> 00:38:23,182
Huh?
Eh.

410
00:38:23,208 --> 00:38:24,976
Huh?
Eh.

411
00:38:25,001 --> 00:38:26,230
Huh?

412
00:38:26,255 --> 00:38:27,733
Please.

413
00:38:28,445 --> 00:38:30,764
- The Ileenium system?
- Yeah, the Ileenium system.

414
00:38:30,789 --> 00:38:32,960
That's the one. Get us there
as fast as you can.

415
00:38:32,961 --> 00:38:34,461
I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal.

416
00:38:34,463 --> 00:38:35,630
I need the bonding tape, hurry!

417
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:36,797
What about you?

418
00:38:36,798 --> 00:38:39,175
- I gotta get back to Jakku.
- Back to Jak...

419
00:38:39,175 --> 00:38:40,719
Why does everyone
wanna go back to Jakku?

420
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:41,989
- It's not that one.
- That place is...

421
00:38:42,014 --> 00:38:43,405
No.
No.

422
00:38:43,431 --> 00:38:45,389
The one I'm pointing to.
No.

423
00:38:45,391 --> 00:38:46,807
No.
No!

424
00:38:46,809 --> 00:38:48,782
If we don't patch it up the
propulsion tank will overflow...

425
00:38:48,807 --> 00:38:51,186
and flood the ship with poisonous gas!

426
00:38:51,188 --> 00:38:53,047
- This?
- Yes.

427
00:38:53,262 --> 00:38:56,181
Hey, Rey, you're a pilot.

428
00:38:56,206 --> 00:38:58,461
You can fly anywhere.
Why go back?

429
00:38:58,487 --> 00:38:59,862
You got a family?

430
00:38:59,864 --> 00:39:01,114
You got a boyfriend?
A cute boyfriend?

431
00:39:01,114 --> 00:39:03,275
None of your business, that's why.

432
00:39:04,994 --> 00:39:07,326
- That can't be good.
- No, it can't be.

433
00:39:12,335 --> 00:39:15,704
Someone's locked on to us.
All controls are overridden.

434
00:39:21,373 --> 00:39:23,784
Get off!
Get off!

435
00:39:25,481 --> 00:39:27,181
See anything?

436
00:39:27,724 --> 00:39:29,425
Oh, no.

437
00:39:36,983 --> 00:39:38,068
It's the First Order.

438
00:39:38,068 --> 00:39:40,630
What do we do?
There must be something.

439
00:39:40,655 --> 00:39:42,405
- You said poisonous gas.
- I fixed that.

440
00:39:42,405 --> 00:39:44,275
Can you unfix it?

441
00:39:49,204 --> 00:39:50,905
Come on, BB-8.

442
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:52,686
I got him.

443
00:39:55,023 --> 00:39:56,579
I'm okay.

444
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:58,458
BB-8, get off me!

445
00:39:58,483 --> 00:40:00,637
Oh, stop your whining!

446
00:40:01,175 --> 00:40:02,925
Do you think this will work
on the stormtroopers?

447
00:40:02,927 --> 00:40:06,170
Yeah. Their masks filter out
smoke, not toxins.

448
00:40:12,853 --> 00:40:14,882
- Hurry.
- I'm hurrying.

449
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,840
Chewie...

450
00:40:28,494 --> 00:40:30,445
we're home.

451
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,253
Yeah.

452
00:40:45,541 --> 00:40:46,969
Where are the others?

453
00:40:46,994 --> 00:40:48,780
- Where's the pilot?
<i>- I'm the pilot.</i>

454
00:40:48,806 --> 00:40:50,347
- You?
- She's lying!

455
00:40:50,349 --> 00:40:52,150
<i>No, it's true.
We're the only ones on board.</i>

456
00:40:52,175 --> 00:40:53,572
<i>You can understand that thing?</i>

457
00:40:53,597 --> 00:40:55,858
And "that thing" can understand
you, too, so watch it.

458
00:40:55,882 --> 00:40:57,782
Come on out of there.

459
00:40:58,702 --> 00:41:00,900
- Where'd you get this ship?
- Niima Outpost.

460
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,177
Jakku?
That junkyard?

461
00:41:03,202 --> 00:41:04,407
Thank you!
Junkyard.

462
00:41:04,432 --> 00:41:06,989
Told you we should have
double-checked the Western Reaches.

463
00:41:06,990 --> 00:41:08,565
Who had it?
Ducain?

464
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:10,744
I stole it.
From Unkar Plutt.

465
00:41:10,744 --> 00:41:13,079
He stole it from the Irving Boys,
who stole it from Ducain.

466
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:15,105
Who stole it from me!

467
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,958
Well, you tell him that Han Solo...

468
00:41:16,958 --> 00:41:19,460
just stole back the
<i>Millennium Falcon</i> for good.

469
00:41:19,461 --> 00:41:23,039
This is the <i>Millennium Falcon?</i>
You're Han Solo?

470
00:41:23,965 --> 00:41:26,175
I used to be.

471
00:41:26,177 --> 00:41:27,719
Han Solo, the Rebellion general?

472
00:41:27,719 --> 00:41:29,179
No, the smuggler.

473
00:41:29,179 --> 00:41:31,097
- Wasn't he a war hero?
- I don't know.

474
00:41:31,097 --> 00:41:34,516
This is the ship that made
the Kessel Run in 14 parsecs?

475
00:41:34,518 --> 00:41:36,469
12 !

476
00:41:36,853 --> 00:41:39,014
14.

477
00:41:53,661 --> 00:41:55,329
Hey!

478
00:41:55,331 --> 00:41:58,416
Some moof-milker
put a compressor on the ignition line.

479
00:41:58,416 --> 00:42:01,043
Unkar Plutt did. I thought it was
a mistake, too. Puts too much...

480
00:42:01,045 --> 00:42:03,565
- stress on the hyperdrive.
- Stress on the hyperdrive.

481
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,804
Chewie, throw them in a pod.

482
00:42:05,829 --> 00:42:08,230
We'll drop them at the
nearest inhabited planet.

483
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,719
Wait, no.

484
00:42:09,719 --> 00:42:12,057
- We need your help.
- My help?

485
00:42:12,083 --> 00:42:13,824
This droid has to get
to the Resistance base...

486
00:42:13,849 --> 00:42:15,842
as soon as possible.

487
00:42:15,851 --> 00:42:18,929
He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker.

488
00:42:22,733 --> 00:42:26,353
You are the Han Solo that
fought with the Rebellion.

489
00:42:31,742 --> 00:42:33,443
You knew him.

490
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:39,289
Yeah.
I knew him.

491
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:41,233
I knew Luke.

492
00:42:43,711 --> 00:42:46,672
Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten loose.

493
00:42:46,673 --> 00:42:48,567
Wait, what?

494
00:42:48,592 --> 00:42:50,960
Did you just say Rathtars?

495
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:52,094
Hey!

496
00:42:52,096 --> 00:42:55,181
You're not hauling Rathtars
on this freighter, are you?

497
00:42:55,181 --> 00:42:57,474
I'm hauling Rathtars.

498
00:42:57,476 --> 00:43:00,769
Oh, great.
It's the Guavian Death Gang.

499
00:43:00,771 --> 00:43:02,548
Must have tracked us from Nantoon.

500
00:43:02,574 --> 00:43:04,231
What's a Rathtar?

501
00:43:04,233 --> 00:43:05,817
They're big and they're dangerous.

502
00:43:05,818 --> 00:43:07,443
You ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?

503
00:43:07,443 --> 00:43:08,570
- No.
- Good.

504
00:43:08,570 --> 00:43:10,530
I got three of them going to King Prana.

505
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:12,949
Three?
How'd you get them on board?

506
00:43:12,949 --> 00:43:16,572
- I used to have a bigger crew.
- Yeah.

507
00:43:16,597 --> 00:43:18,402
We sure could use them right now.

508
00:43:18,427 --> 00:43:20,248
Get below and stay there
until I say so...

509
00:43:20,248 --> 00:43:21,916
and don't even think about
taking the <i>Falcon.</i>

510
00:43:21,916 --> 00:43:23,001
What about BB-8?

511
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:24,793
He stays with me
until I get rid of the gang...

512
00:43:24,795 --> 00:43:26,420
then you can have him back
and be on your way.

513
00:43:26,422 --> 00:43:29,081
What about the Rathtars?
Where are you keeping them?

514
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,927
- There's one.
- What are you gonna do?

515
00:43:32,927 --> 00:43:35,284
Same thing I always do.
Talk my way out of it.

516
00:43:35,309 --> 00:43:36,440
Do you?

517
00:43:36,465 --> 00:43:39,425
Yes, I do.
Every time.

518
00:43:56,076 --> 00:43:58,161
Han Solo.

519
00:43:58,161 --> 00:43:59,746
You're a dead man.

520
00:43:59,746 --> 00:44:02,664
Bala-Tik.
What's the problem?

521
00:44:02,666 --> 00:44:05,501
The problem is we loaned you
50,000 for this job.

522
00:44:05,501 --> 00:44:07,963
- Can you see them?
- No.

523
00:44:07,987 --> 00:44:11,317
I heard you also borrowed
50,000 from Kanjiklub.

524
00:44:11,342 --> 00:44:14,135
You know you can't trust
those little freaks.

525
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:16,614
How long we known each other?

526
00:44:16,639 --> 00:44:18,972
- They have blasters.
- A lot of them.

527
00:44:18,974 --> 00:44:22,268
Not long.
We want our money back now.

528
00:44:22,268 --> 00:44:24,353
You think hunting
Rathtars is cheap?

529
00:44:24,355 --> 00:44:25,605
I spent that money.

530
00:44:25,606 --> 00:44:27,963
Kanjiklub wants
their investment back, too.

531
00:44:27,987 --> 00:44:30,338
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!

532
00:44:30,362 --> 00:44:32,940
Tell that to Kanjiklub.

533
00:44:41,704 --> 00:44:43,998
Tasu Leech.

534
00:44:43,998 --> 00:44:45,494
Good to see you.

535
00:44:45,519 --> 00:44:49,744
Wrong again, Solo.
It's over for you.

536
00:44:53,842 --> 00:44:56,927
Boys, you're both gonna
get what I promised.

537
00:44:56,929 --> 00:44:59,347
Have I ever not delivered
for you before?

538
00:44:59,373 --> 00:45:00,501
Yeah.

539
00:45:00,527 --> 00:45:02,282
Twice!

540
00:45:04,186 --> 00:45:06,898
- What was the second time?
- Your game is old.

541
00:45:06,923 --> 00:45:09,969
There's no one in the galaxy
left for you to swindle.

542
00:45:09,994 --> 00:45:12,179
Nowhere left to hide.

543
00:45:12,204 --> 00:45:13,568
That BB unit.

544
00:45:13,570 --> 00:45:17,106
The First Order is looking
for one just like it.

545
00:45:19,581 --> 00:45:21,936
And two fugitives.

546
00:45:25,081 --> 00:45:26,472
First I've heard of it.

547
00:45:26,498 --> 00:45:28,675
- Search the freighter.
- Yes, boss.

548
00:45:31,686 --> 00:45:33,554
Wait, wait, wait.

549
00:45:36,331 --> 00:45:39,737
If we close the blast doors in that
corridor we can trap both gangs!

550
00:45:39,762 --> 00:45:41,304
We'll close the blast doors from here?

551
00:45:41,306 --> 00:45:43,800
Resetting the fuses should do it.

552
00:45:51,065 --> 00:45:52,833
I got a bad feeling about this.

553
00:45:52,858 --> 00:45:55,684
- Oh, no.
- "Oh, no," what?

554
00:45:56,030 --> 00:45:57,112
Wrong fuses.

555
00:45:57,114 --> 00:45:58,405
Kill them!

556
00:45:58,407 --> 00:46:00,315
- Whoa...
- And take the droid!

557
00:46:25,434 --> 00:46:27,969
- This was a mistake!
- Huge!

558
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:42,192
What do they look like?

559
00:46:47,456 --> 00:46:49,706
They look like that.

560
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:54,244
- This way.
- Are you sure?

561
00:46:55,463 --> 00:46:57,648
No, no, no!

562
00:46:57,673 --> 00:46:59,391
Finn!

563
00:47:00,052 --> 00:47:01,583
Finn!

564
00:47:02,527 --> 00:47:04,228
Ahh!
Rey!

565
00:47:06,094 --> 00:47:08,086
Get off!
Get off!

566
00:47:13,023 --> 00:47:15,864
- Rey! Rey!
- Finn!

567
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,485
Finn!

568
00:47:18,487 --> 00:47:20,855
<i>Get off me!</i>

569
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:34,034
<i>Rey!</i>

570
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:35,818
Aahhhh!

571
00:47:37,650 --> 00:47:40,233
Get off! Get off!
Get...

572
00:47:41,677 --> 00:47:43,222
Finn!

573
00:47:43,663 --> 00:47:46,842
- It had me! But the door...
- That was lucky.

574
00:47:50,018 --> 00:47:52,541
I got the door.
Cover us!

575
00:47:56,335 --> 00:47:57,711
Hurry!

576
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,938
- Awww!
- Chewie!

577
00:48:04,001 --> 00:48:06,286
- You okay?
- Yeah, yeah.

578
00:48:06,869 --> 00:48:08,570
Wow.

579
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:11,905
Come on!
Come on!

580
00:48:15,306 --> 00:48:16,387
Han.

581
00:48:16,413 --> 00:48:19,851
You, close the door behind us.
You, take care of Chewie!

582
00:48:27,054 --> 00:48:28,389
Hey, where are you going?

583
00:48:28,389 --> 00:48:30,141
Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump, too.

584
00:48:30,141 --> 00:48:32,059
If we don't prime that,
we're not going anywhere.

585
00:48:32,059 --> 00:48:34,559
- I hate that guy.
- And you could use a co-pilot.

586
00:48:34,585 --> 00:48:36,655
I got one,
he's back there.

587
00:48:38,317 --> 00:48:40,400
Watch the thrust. We're going
out of here at lightspeed.

588
00:48:40,402 --> 00:48:42,277
From inside the hangar?
Is that even possible?

589
00:48:42,278 --> 00:48:45,360
I never ask that question
till after I've done it.

590
00:48:46,782 --> 00:48:48,875
This is not how I thought
this day was gonna go.

591
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,054
Angle the shield.
Hang on back there!

592
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:52,947
No problem!

593
00:49:02,173 --> 00:49:04,335
Come on, baby,
don't let me down.

594
00:49:05,842 --> 00:49:08,503
- What?
- Compressor.

595
00:49:16,438 --> 00:49:19,648
Inform the First Order,
that Han Solo has the droid they want.

596
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:22,351
And it's aboard the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>

597
00:49:30,577 --> 00:49:35,657
<i>The droid will soon be
delivered to the Resistance...</i>

598
00:49:36,166 --> 00:49:40,661
leading them to the last Jedi.

599
00:49:41,170 --> 00:49:45,465
If Skywalker returns...

600
00:49:45,467 --> 00:49:50,170
the new Jedi will rise.

601
00:49:50,639 --> 00:49:52,306
Supreme Leader,
I take full responsibility...

602
00:49:52,306 --> 00:49:54,675
General!

603
00:49:56,186 --> 00:49:59,105
Our strategy must now change.

604
00:49:59,106 --> 00:50:01,273
The weapon.
It is ready.

605
00:50:01,275 --> 00:50:03,650
I believe the time has come to use it.

606
00:50:03,652 --> 00:50:05,027
We shall destroy the government...

607
00:50:05,027 --> 00:50:06,528
that supports the Resistance...

608
00:50:06,530 --> 00:50:08,322
the Republic.

609
00:50:08,322 --> 00:50:09,949
Without their friends to protect them...

610
00:50:09,949 --> 00:50:11,784
the Resistance will be vulnerable.

611
00:50:11,784 --> 00:50:14,786
And we will stop them
before they reach Skywalker.

612
00:50:14,788 --> 00:50:16,739
Go.

613
00:50:16,831 --> 00:50:18,331
Oversee preparations.

614
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:20,702
Yes, Supreme Leader.

615
00:50:25,965 --> 00:50:28,041
There has been an awakening.

616
00:50:29,052 --> 00:50:31,503
Have you felt it?

617
00:50:32,347 --> 00:50:34,090
<i>Yes.</i>

618
00:50:34,766 --> 00:50:37,092
There's something more.

619
00:50:37,936 --> 00:50:42,806
The droid we seek is aboard
the <i>Millennium Falcon.</i>

620
00:50:42,898 --> 00:50:45,860
In the hands of your father...

621
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:50,398
Han Solo.

622
00:50:52,231 --> 00:50:54,432
<i>He means nothing to me.</i>

623
00:50:54,458 --> 00:51:00,224
Even you, master of the
Knights of Ren...

624
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:04,090
have never faced such a test.

625
00:51:04,115 --> 00:51:08,027
<i>By the grace of your training,
I will not be seduced.</i>

626
00:51:08,409 --> 00:51:10,943
We shall see.

627
00:51:13,096 --> 00:51:15,630
We shall see.

628
00:51:22,820 --> 00:51:25,358
- Electrical overload.
- I can fix that.

629
00:51:25,358 --> 00:51:27,528
Coolant's leaking.

630
00:51:27,766 --> 00:51:29,295
Try transferring auxiliary power to ...

631
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:30,780
- the secondary tank.
- The secondary tank.

632
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:32,489
I got it.

633
00:51:32,490 --> 00:51:34,817
Chewie, come on!

634
00:51:35,744 --> 00:51:37,411
I need help with this giant hairy thing!

635
00:51:37,411 --> 00:51:39,378
- I'm coming.
- Stop moving!

636
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:41,110
- Ahhhh!
- Chewie!

637
00:51:41,135 --> 00:51:42,351
Chewie looks seriously hurt.

638
00:51:42,376 --> 00:51:44,295
You hurt Chewie,
you're gonna deal with me!

639
00:51:44,320 --> 00:51:47,438
Hurt him?
He almost killed me six times!

640
00:51:47,463 --> 00:51:49,047
Which is fine!

641
00:51:49,048 --> 00:51:50,590
This hyperdrive blows,
there are gonna be...

642
00:51:50,592 --> 00:51:53,251
pieces of us in three different systems.

643
00:51:55,931 --> 00:51:57,710
What'd you do?

644
00:51:57,974 --> 00:52:00,722
I bypassed the compressor.

645
00:52:02,228 --> 00:52:03,929
Huh.

646
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:08,349
Move, ball.

647
00:52:09,945 --> 00:52:12,112
Ah, don't say that.

648
00:52:12,114 --> 00:52:14,481
You did great.
Just rest.

649
00:52:14,699 --> 00:52:16,242
Good job, kid.

650
00:52:16,242 --> 00:52:17,784
Thanks.

651
00:52:17,786 --> 00:52:19,579
You're welcome.

652
00:52:23,833 --> 00:52:25,376
So...

653
00:52:25,376 --> 00:52:27,411
fugitives, huh?

654
00:52:28,436 --> 00:52:30,005
The First Order wants the map.

655
00:52:30,005 --> 00:52:31,923
Finn is with the Resistance.

656
00:52:31,925 --> 00:52:34,043
I'm just a scavenger.

657
00:52:35,387 --> 00:52:37,130
Let's see what you got.

658
00:52:37,155 --> 00:52:39,940
- Mistress?
- Go ahead.

659
00:52:48,958 --> 00:52:50,733
This map's not complete.

660
00:52:50,735 --> 00:52:52,936
It's just a piece.

661
00:52:53,262 --> 00:52:57,326
Ever since Luke disappeared
people have been looking for him.

662
00:52:57,351 --> 00:52:59,552
Why did he leave?

663
00:53:00,161 --> 00:53:02,996
He was training
a new generation of Jedi.

664
00:53:02,998 --> 00:53:04,748
One boy, an apprentice...

665
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:07,543
turned against him,destroyed it all.

666
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:10,628
Luke felt responsible.

667
00:53:10,630 --> 00:53:13,833
He just walked away from everything.

668
00:53:13,842 --> 00:53:15,467
Do you know what happened to him?

669
00:53:15,469 --> 00:53:18,545
A lot of rumors.
Stories.

670
00:53:19,847 --> 00:53:22,494
People that knew him best...

671
00:53:23,559 --> 00:53:26,782
think he went looking
for the first Jedi temple.

672
00:53:27,463 --> 00:53:29,014
The Jedi were real?

673
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,400
I used to wonder about that myself.

674
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:34,311
Thought it was a bunch
of mumbo-jumbo.

675
00:53:34,487 --> 00:53:37,155
A magical power holding
together good and evil...

676
00:53:37,157 --> 00:53:39,541
the dark side and the light.

677
00:53:40,445 --> 00:53:43,315
Crazy thing is...

678
00:53:45,393 --> 00:53:47,135
it's true.

679
00:53:48,903 --> 00:53:51,358
The Force.
The Jedi.

680
00:53:53,422 --> 00:53:55,123
All of it.

681
00:53:57,442 --> 00:53:59,476
It's all true.

682
00:54:02,264 --> 00:54:04,516
No, you rest.

683
00:54:04,518 --> 00:54:07,231
You want my help?
You're getting it.

684
00:54:07,255 --> 00:54:10,311
Gonna see an old friend.
She'll get your droid home.

685
00:54:10,501 --> 00:54:12,536
This is our stop.

686
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:32,994
I didn't know there was this much
green in the whole galaxy.

687
00:55:00,282 --> 00:55:02,449
Hey, Solo, I'm not sure what
we're walking into here...

688
00:55:02,449 --> 00:55:04,036
Did you just call me Solo?

689
00:55:04,061 --> 00:55:05,869
Sorry. Han.
Mr. Solo.

690
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:07,036
You should know...

691
00:55:07,038 --> 00:55:09,293
I'm a big deal in the Resistance.

692
00:55:09,318 --> 00:55:11,778
Which puts a real target on my back.

693
00:55:11,804 --> 00:55:13,603
Are there any conspirators here?

694
00:55:13,628 --> 00:55:15,628
Like, First Order sympathizers?

695
00:55:15,630 --> 00:55:18,083
Listen, Big Deal.

696
00:55:18,108 --> 00:55:20,108
You got another problem.

697
00:55:20,239 --> 00:55:23,108
Women always figure out the truth.

698
00:55:24,139 --> 00:55:26,172
Always.

699
00:55:31,478 --> 00:55:33,556
You might need this.

700
00:55:34,148 --> 00:55:35,940
I think I can handle myself.

701
00:55:35,942 --> 00:55:38,152
I know you do. That's why
I'm giving it to you.

702
00:55:38,152 --> 00:55:39,853
Take it.

703
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,239
You know how to use one of those?

704
00:55:43,240 --> 00:55:44,992
Yeah.
You pull the trigger.

705
00:55:44,992 --> 00:55:47,327
Little bit more to it than that.

706
00:55:47,329 --> 00:55:49,697
You got a lot to learn.

707
00:55:50,414 --> 00:55:52,365
You got a name?

708
00:55:52,391 --> 00:55:54,092
Rey.

709
00:55:54,293 --> 00:55:55,994
Rey.

710
00:55:59,028 --> 00:56:01,675
I been thinking about bringing
on some more crew, Rey.

711
00:56:01,675 --> 00:56:03,498
A second mate.
Someone to help out.

712
00:56:03,545 --> 00:56:05,429
Someone who can keep up
with Chewie and me...

713
00:56:05,429 --> 00:56:07,139
appreciates the <i>Falcon.</i>

714
00:56:07,139 --> 00:56:08,742
Are you offering me a job?

715
00:56:08,766 --> 00:56:11,619
I wouldn't be nice to you.
Doesn't pay much.

716
00:56:11,644 --> 00:56:14,179
You're offering me a job.

717
00:56:14,418 --> 00:56:16,619
I'm thinking about it.

718
00:56:19,699 --> 00:56:21,567
Well?

719
00:56:25,313 --> 00:56:28,827
If you were, I'd be flattered.
But I have to get home.

720
00:56:29,119 --> 00:56:30,827
Where, Jakku?

721
00:56:30,853 --> 00:56:33,346
I've already been away too long.

722
00:56:34,536 --> 00:56:37,257
Chewie, check out the ship
as best you can.

723
00:56:37,282 --> 00:56:38,809
Okay.

724
00:56:40,536 --> 00:56:44,418
That's too bad.
Chewie kind of likes you.

725
00:56:46,804 --> 00:56:48,597
Solo, why are we here again?

726
00:56:48,597 --> 00:56:50,224
To get your droid on a clean ship.

727
00:56:50,224 --> 00:56:51,266
Clean?

728
00:56:51,266 --> 00:56:54,407
You think it was luck
that Chewie and I found the <i>Falcon?</i>

729
00:56:54,432 --> 00:56:56,438
If we can find it on our scanners...

730
00:56:56,438 --> 00:56:58,898
the First Order's not far behind.

731
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,777
Wanna get BB-8 to the Resistance?

732
00:57:01,777 --> 00:57:04,463
Maz Kanata's our best bet.

733
00:57:04,489 --> 00:57:05,960
We can trust her, right?

734
00:57:06,012 --> 00:57:07,740
Relax, kid.

735
00:57:07,742 --> 00:57:11,112
She's run this watering hole
for a thousand years.

736
00:57:11,161 --> 00:57:13,288
Maz is a bit of an acquired taste...

737
00:57:13,289 --> 00:57:14,748
so let me do the talking.

738
00:57:14,748 --> 00:57:16,583
And whatever you do, don't stare.

739
00:57:16,583 --> 00:57:18,327
- At what?
- At what?

740
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:20,454
Any of it.

741
00:57:40,634 --> 00:57:43,335
Han Solo!

742
00:57:46,981 --> 00:57:48,489
Oh, boy.

743
00:57:48,490 --> 00:57:50,358
Hey, Maz.

744
00:57:53,172 --> 00:57:55,831
Where's my boyfriend?

745
00:57:55,833 --> 00:57:57,373
Chewie's working on the <i>Falcon.</i>

746
00:57:57,398 --> 00:57:59,181
I like that Wookiee.

747
00:57:59,206 --> 00:58:01,402
I assume you need something.

748
00:58:01,403 --> 00:58:02,905
Desperately.

749
00:58:02,905 --> 00:58:04,827
Let's get to it.

750
00:58:09,054 --> 00:58:11,284
Wow.
Look at this place.

751
00:58:12,134 --> 00:58:14,264
I'll be right back.

752
00:58:29,614 --> 00:58:31,704
Alert the Resistance....

753
00:58:31,728 --> 00:58:34,431
... their missing droid is here!

754
00:58:39,217 --> 00:58:43,710
Inform the First Order...
I've found the droid.

755
00:58:58,460 --> 00:59:00,621
<i>Forgive me.</i>

756
00:59:02,590 --> 00:59:04,958
<i>I feel it again.</i>

757
00:59:07,929 --> 00:59:10,172
<i>The pull to the light.</i>

758
00:59:12,307 --> 00:59:15,510
<i>Supreme Leader senses it.</i>

759
00:59:15,894 --> 00:59:17,771
<i>Show me again.</i>

760
00:59:17,771 --> 00:59:20,641
<i>The power of the darkness.</i>

761
00:59:21,233 --> 00:59:24,519
<i>And I will let nothing stand in our way.</i>

762
00:59:24,778 --> 00:59:26,856
<i>Show me...</i>

763
00:59:28,324 --> 00:59:30,358
<i>Grandfather...</i>

764
00:59:32,119 --> 00:59:34,579
<i>and I will finish...</i>

765
00:59:34,581 --> 00:59:36,657
<i>what you started.</i>

766
00:59:48,146 --> 00:59:50,804
- ... to the Resistance.
- A map.

767
00:59:50,804 --> 00:59:53,014
To Skywalker himself?

768
00:59:53,016 --> 00:59:55,851
You are right back
in the mess.

769
00:59:55,851 --> 01:00:00,014
Maz, I need you to get
this droid to Leia.

770
01:00:00,148 --> 01:00:01,273
Hmm...

771
01:00:01,273 --> 01:00:02,974
No.

772
01:00:03,650 --> 01:00:08,155
You've been running away
from this fight for too long.

773
01:00:08,155 --> 01:00:09,523
Han.

774
01:00:09,548 --> 01:00:11,800
*I can see you missed her too.

775
01:00:11,826 --> 01:00:13,994
Go home.

776
01:00:13,994 --> 01:00:15,369
Leia doesn't wanna see me.

777
01:00:15,371 --> 01:00:18,282
Please, we came here for your help.

778
01:00:18,833 --> 01:00:20,735
What fight?

779
01:00:21,043 --> 01:00:23,170
The only fight.

780
01:00:23,170 --> 01:00:25,422
Against the dark side.

781
01:00:25,422 --> 01:00:26,840
Through the ages...

782
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:29,668
I've seen evil take many forms.

783
01:00:30,052 --> 01:00:32,346
The Sith.
The Empire.

784
01:00:32,347 --> 01:00:36,382
Today, it is the First Order.

785
01:00:36,476 --> 01:00:39,519
Their shadow is spreading
across the galaxy.

786
01:00:39,521 --> 01:00:41,021
We must face them.

787
01:00:41,021 --> 01:00:43,190
Fight them.

788
01:00:43,190 --> 01:00:45,358
All of us.

789
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:47,027
There is no fight against
the First Order.

790
01:00:47,027 --> 01:00:48,853
Not one we can win.

791
01:00:49,364 --> 01:00:50,697
Look around.

792
01:00:50,697 --> 01:00:53,199
There's no chance we haven't
been recognized already.

793
01:00:53,201 --> 01:00:56,110
I bet you the First Order
is on their way right...

794
01:00:56,614 --> 01:00:58,315
What's this?

795
01:00:59,541 --> 01:01:01,242
What are you doing?

796
01:01:05,255 --> 01:01:06,880
Solo, what is she doing?

797
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:08,798
I don't know.
But it ain't good.

798
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,675
If you live long enough...

799
01:01:10,677 --> 01:01:14,880
you see the same eyes
in different people.

800
01:01:15,097 --> 01:01:20,260
I'm looking at the eyes
of a man who wants to run.

801
01:01:22,438 --> 01:01:25,099
You don't know a thing about me.

802
01:01:25,733 --> 01:01:29,402
Where I'm from.
What I've seen.

803
01:01:29,403 --> 01:01:32,773
You don't know the First Order like I do.

804
01:01:33,032 --> 01:01:35,284
They'll slaughter us.

805
01:01:35,284 --> 01:01:38,112
We all need to run.

806
01:01:38,371 --> 01:01:40,114
Hmm.

807
01:01:45,878 --> 01:01:47,579
You see those two?

808
01:01:47,588 --> 01:01:50,840
They'll trade work for transportation
to the Outer Rim.

809
01:01:50,842 --> 01:01:53,260
There, you can disappear.

810
01:01:53,260 --> 01:01:54,961
Finn?

811
01:01:56,681 --> 01:01:58,382
Come with me.

812
01:01:58,724 --> 01:02:00,851
What about BB-8?
We're not done yet.

813
01:02:00,851 --> 01:02:03,219
We have to get him back to your base.

814
01:02:07,608 --> 01:02:09,643
I can't.

815
01:02:17,744 --> 01:02:19,652
Keep it, kid.

816
01:02:29,009 --> 01:02:31,128
Who's the girl?

817
01:02:31,152 --> 01:02:35,570
- Trade. He wants to trade.
- Let's hear him out.

818
01:02:35,594 --> 01:02:37,637
I was told you can get me
to the Outer Rim.

819
01:02:37,639 --> 01:02:39,422
What are you doing?

820
01:02:40,474 --> 01:02:42,175
Don't leave without me.

821
01:02:45,313 --> 01:02:47,230
You can't just go. I won't let you.

822
01:02:47,231 --> 01:02:48,398
I'm not who you think I am.

823
01:02:48,398 --> 01:02:49,565
Finn, what are you talking about?

824
01:02:49,567 --> 01:02:51,309
I'm not Resistance.

825
01:02:51,318 --> 01:02:53,519
I'm not a hero.

826
01:02:56,074 --> 01:02:58,525
I'm a stormtrooper.

827
01:02:58,992 --> 01:03:02,612
Like all of them, I was taken
from a family I'll never know.

828
01:03:02,664 --> 01:03:05,365
And raised to do one thing.

829
01:03:05,375 --> 01:03:09,202
But my first battle, I made a choice.

830
01:03:09,670 --> 01:03:12,172
I wasn't gonna kill for them.

831
01:03:12,172 --> 01:03:15,793
So I ran.
Right into you.

832
01:03:16,677 --> 01:03:19,463
And you looked at me
like no one ever had.

833
01:03:21,682 --> 01:03:24,677
I was ashamed of what I was.

834
01:03:26,521 --> 01:03:28,646
But I'm done with the First Order.

835
01:03:28,648 --> 01:03:31,141
I'm never going back.

836
01:03:32,527 --> 01:03:34,978
Rey, come with me.

837
01:03:35,362 --> 01:03:37,313
Don't go.

838
01:03:41,786 --> 01:03:44,237
Take care of yourself.

839
01:03:45,331 --> 01:03:47,699
Please.

840
01:04:00,722 --> 01:04:02,889
<i>No!</i>

841
01:04:02,889 --> 01:04:05,759
<i>No!</i>

842
01:04:18,364 --> 01:04:21,942
<i>No! Come back!</i>

843
01:04:22,242 --> 01:04:24,737
<i>No!</i>

844
01:04:40,094 --> 01:04:42,628
<i>Come back!</i>

845
01:04:52,273 --> 01:04:54,807
<i>No!</i>

846
01:05:45,076 --> 01:05:46,992
<i>No!</i>

847
01:05:46,994 --> 01:05:49,237
<i>Its energy...</i>

848
01:05:52,333 --> 01:05:54,501
- ...<i>surrounds us...</i>
<i>- No!</i>

849
01:05:54,501 --> 01:05:57,538
...<i>and binds us...</i>

850
01:06:04,679 --> 01:06:06,505
<i>The Force will be...</i>

851
01:06:14,856 --> 01:06:16,481
<i>No!</i>

852
01:06:16,481 --> 01:06:18,483
Come back!

853
01:06:18,483 --> 01:06:20,686
<i>Quiet, girl.</i>

854
01:06:20,862 --> 01:06:22,563
No!

855
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:28,150
<i>Rey?</i>

856
01:06:32,039 --> 01:06:35,449
<i>These are your first steps.</i>

857
01:06:39,713 --> 01:06:41,414
What was that?

858
01:06:42,967 --> 01:06:45,376
I shouldn't have gone in there.

859
01:06:46,929 --> 01:06:49,472
That lightsaber was Luke's.

860
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:51,391
And his father's before him.

861
01:06:51,391 --> 01:06:55,144
And now, it calls to you.

862
01:06:55,146 --> 01:06:57,230
I have to get back to Jakku.

863
01:06:57,231 --> 01:06:59,599
Han told me.

864
01:07:06,657 --> 01:07:08,782
Dear child.

865
01:07:08,784 --> 01:07:10,911
I see your eyes.

866
01:07:10,911 --> 01:07:13,996
You already know the truth.

867
01:07:13,998 --> 01:07:17,159
Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku...

868
01:07:17,751 --> 01:07:20,454
they're never coming back.

869
01:07:25,800 --> 01:07:27,010
But...

870
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:30,130
there's someone who still could.

871
01:07:32,141 --> 01:07:33,807
Luke.

872
01:07:33,809 --> 01:07:37,603
The belonging you seek
is not behind you...

873
01:07:37,605 --> 01:07:39,396
it is ahead.

874
01:07:39,398 --> 01:07:43,068
I am no Jedi, but I know the Force.

875
01:07:43,068 --> 01:07:47,856
It moves through and surrounds
every living thing.

876
01:07:49,074 --> 01:07:51,360
Close your eyes.

877
01:07:52,954 --> 01:07:54,655
Feel it.

878
01:07:55,248 --> 01:07:57,456
The light...

879
01:07:57,458 --> 01:07:59,960
it's always been there.

880
01:07:59,960 --> 01:08:02,663
It will guide you.

881
01:08:04,090 --> 01:08:06,833
The saber. Take it.

882
01:08:10,137 --> 01:08:12,179
I'm never touching that thing again.

883
01:08:12,181 --> 01:08:14,382
I don't want any part of this.

884
01:08:17,144 --> 01:08:18,845
Hmm.

885
01:08:40,167 --> 01:08:44,371
<i>Today is the end
of the Republic.</i>

886
01:08:45,672 --> 01:08:51,877
<i>The end of a regime
that acquiesces to disorder.</i>

887
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:56,682
<i>At this very moment,
in a system far from here...</i>

888
01:08:56,684 --> 01:09:01,645
<i>the New Republic lies to the galaxy...</i>

889
01:09:01,646 --> 01:09:05,934
<i>while secretly supporting
the treachery...</i>

890
01:09:06,027 --> 01:09:09,445
<i>of the loathsome Resistance.</i>

891
01:09:09,447 --> 01:09:13,033
<i>This fierce machine
which you have built...</i>

892
01:09:13,033 --> 01:09:14,993
<i>upon which we stand...</i>

893
01:09:14,993 --> 01:09:17,453
<i>will bring an end to the Senate!</i>

894
01:09:17,454 --> 01:09:20,372
<i>To their cherished fleet!</i>

895
01:09:20,373 --> 01:09:24,918
<i>All remaining systems
will bow to the First Order!</i>

896
01:09:24,920 --> 01:09:27,546
<i>And will remember this...</i>

897
01:09:27,547 --> 01:09:32,993
<i>as the last day of the Republic!</i>

898
01:09:34,387 --> 01:09:36,597
Confirm transfer to manual control.

899
01:09:36,599 --> 01:09:38,265
Configure!

900
01:09:38,266 --> 01:09:40,426
<i>Fire!</i>

901
01:10:28,359 --> 01:10:31,850
*Hosnian System*

902
01:10:33,992 --> 01:10:36,560
*Republic City

903
01:10:39,587 --> 01:10:42,586
No.
What is it?

904
01:10:58,471 --> 01:11:00,340
It was the Republic.

905
01:11:00,807 --> 01:11:03,135
The First Order, they've done it.

906
01:11:04,811 --> 01:11:06,680
Where's Rey?

907
01:11:20,938 --> 01:11:23,221
Mistress.
Are you alright?

908
01:11:23,247 --> 01:11:26,475
- What are you doing?
- I saw you running, are you alright?

909
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,792
- You have to go back.
- We'll go back together.

910
01:11:28,793 --> 01:11:30,619
I'm leaving.

911
01:11:30,671 --> 01:11:32,255
- BB-8...
- Why.

912
01:11:32,256 --> 01:11:33,278
No, you can't.

913
01:11:33,302 --> 01:11:35,650
You have to go back,
you're too important.

914
01:11:35,676 --> 01:11:37,694
They'll help you.

915
01:11:51,524 --> 01:11:53,518
I've had this for ages.

916
01:11:56,863 --> 01:11:58,655
Kept it locked away.

917
01:11:58,657 --> 01:12:00,358
Where'd you get that?

918
01:12:00,951 --> 01:12:04,738
A good question.
For another time.

919
01:12:05,038 --> 01:12:06,206
Take it.

920
01:12:06,207 --> 01:12:08,408
Find your friend!

921
01:12:14,881 --> 01:12:17,007
Those beasts.

922
01:12:17,009 --> 01:12:18,938
They're here.

923
01:12:41,908 --> 01:12:45,278
<i>FN-41</i>7<i>, hold position.</i>

924
01:12:46,412 --> 01:12:48,782
Oh, safety.

925
01:12:55,252 --> 01:12:58,048
Wow, mistress, nice shot.

926
01:13:13,774 --> 01:13:14,940
<i>Sir.</i>

927
01:13:14,942 --> 01:13:16,359
<i>The droid was spotted heading west.</i>

928
01:13:16,359 --> 01:13:18,060
<i>With a girl.</i>

929
01:13:22,777 --> 01:13:25,426
You have to keep going.
Stay out of sight.

930
01:13:25,452 --> 01:13:28,371
- I'll try to fight them off.
- I hope they will go away.

931
01:13:28,372 --> 01:13:30,323
I hope so, too.

932
01:13:42,051 --> 01:13:44,671
Come on, Chewie!

933
01:13:46,390 --> 01:13:48,474
Rey and BB-8! They need you!

934
01:13:48,475 --> 01:13:49,559
Now!
Go!

935
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:51,978
I need a weapon!

936
01:13:51,979 --> 01:13:54,139
You have one!

937
01:14:02,823 --> 01:14:06,192
- Hey, can I try that?
- Okay.

938
01:14:10,073 --> 01:14:11,860
Ahhh!

939
01:14:11,998 --> 01:14:14,158
I like this thing.

940
01:14:19,422 --> 01:14:21,416
<i>Traitor!</i>

941
01:15:05,469 --> 01:15:07,386
- You okay, Big Deal?
- Thanks.

942
01:15:07,387 --> 01:15:09,088
<i>Don't move.</i>

943
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:12,091
<i>TK-338, we have targets in custody.</i>

944
01:15:17,564 --> 01:15:19,899
<i>We have incoming at 28. 6.</i>

945
01:15:19,899 --> 01:15:22,601
<i>Move! Move! Move!</i>

946
01:15:22,903 --> 01:15:25,988
<i>Scramble all squads, repeat,
scramble all squads!</i>

947
01:15:25,988 --> 01:15:28,440
<i>Head to higher cover and wait
for our position!</i>

948
01:15:30,577 --> 01:15:32,779
It's the Resistance.

949
01:15:39,920 --> 01:15:42,255
Go straight at them!
Don't let these dogs scare you!

950
01:15:42,256 --> 01:15:44,582
<i>- Copy that.</i>
<i>- We're with you, Poe.</i>

951
01:16:12,618 --> 01:16:14,319
Quick!

952
01:16:41,606 --> 01:16:44,567
Whoo! Yeah!

953
01:16:44,568 --> 01:16:46,569
That's one hell of a pilot!

954
01:16:46,569 --> 01:16:48,520
Whoo-hoo!

955
01:17:42,167 --> 01:17:44,911
<i>The girl I've heard so much about.</i>

956
01:17:56,472 --> 01:17:58,757
<i>The droid.</i>

957
01:17:59,725 --> 01:18:02,720
<i>Where is it?</i>

958
01:18:07,234 --> 01:18:09,560
<i>Request air support.</i>

959
01:18:15,993 --> 01:18:18,069
<i>The map.</i>

960
01:18:19,328 --> 01:18:21,581
<i>You've seen it.</i>

961
01:18:21,582 --> 01:18:24,617
<i>Sir, Resistance fighters.</i>

962
01:18:24,877 --> 01:18:26,586
<i>We need more troops.</i>

963
01:18:26,587 --> 01:18:28,546
<i>Pull the division out.</i>

964
01:18:28,546 --> 01:18:32,292
<i>Forget the droid.
We have what we need.</i>

965
01:18:38,431 --> 01:18:40,425
<i>Pull back to tree line!</i>

966
01:18:55,114 --> 01:18:57,358
No!

967
01:19:00,369 --> 01:19:02,488
No, no!

968
01:19:03,707 --> 01:19:06,492
No! No!

969
01:19:07,461 --> 01:19:09,738
Rey!

970
01:19:27,615 --> 01:19:30,318
He took her.
Did you see that?

971
01:19:30,650 --> 01:19:32,150
He took her. She's gone.

972
01:19:32,152 --> 01:19:34,020
Yeah, yeah, I know.

973
01:19:42,662 --> 01:19:44,697
Let's go.

974
01:19:57,677 --> 01:20:00,304
Goodness! Han Solo!

975
01:20:00,305 --> 01:20:03,015
It is I, C-3PO.

976
01:20:03,015 --> 01:20:06,268
You probably don't recognize me
because of the red arm.

977
01:20:06,269 --> 01:20:08,609
Look who it is,
did you see who...

978
01:20:08,635 --> 01:20:09,957
Oh...

979
01:20:09,981 --> 01:20:11,524
Uh...

980
01:20:11,524 --> 01:20:12,649
Hmm.

981
01:20:12,650 --> 01:20:15,661
Excuse me, Princess...
General. Sorry.

982
01:20:15,685 --> 01:20:18,197
- Come along, BB-8, quickly.
- A red arm, C-3PO?

983
01:20:18,198 --> 01:20:21,567
Yes, I must get
my proper arm reinstalled.

984
01:20:22,587 --> 01:20:25,038
You changed your hair.

985
01:20:26,743 --> 01:20:28,860
Same jacket.

986
01:20:29,395 --> 01:20:31,889
No, new jacket.

987
01:20:44,306 --> 01:20:46,007
I saw him.

988
01:20:47,226 --> 01:20:50,095
Leia, I saw our son.

989
01:20:51,064 --> 01:20:53,056
He was here.

990
01:21:33,148 --> 01:21:34,849
Hey!

991
01:21:36,393 --> 01:21:37,939
Poe.

992
01:21:38,475 --> 01:21:40,738
BB-8, my buddy!

993
01:21:40,738 --> 01:21:42,782
- Oh, it's so good to see you.
- I'm happy to see you too.

994
01:21:42,783 --> 01:21:44,198
Finn saved you?
Where is he?

995
01:21:44,222 --> 01:21:45,229
Over there.

996
01:21:45,253 --> 01:21:46,512
Poe?

997
01:21:47,828 --> 01:21:49,329
Oh, no.

998
01:21:49,331 --> 01:21:50,956
Poe Dameron, you're alive?

999
01:21:50,957 --> 01:21:53,208
- Buddy! So are you!
- What happened to you?

1000
01:21:53,210 --> 01:21:54,627
What happened?
I got thrown from the crash.

1001
01:21:54,627 --> 01:21:56,628
I woke up at night.
No you. No ship. Nothing.

1002
01:21:56,630 --> 01:21:58,130
BB-8 says that you saved him.

1003
01:21:58,131 --> 01:21:59,503
No, no, no.
It wasn't just me.

1004
01:21:59,529 --> 01:22:01,341
You completed my mission, Finn...

1005
01:22:01,342 --> 01:22:02,510
That's my jacket.

1006
01:22:02,511 --> 01:22:04,970
- Oh...
- No, no, no.

1007
01:22:04,970 --> 01:22:07,422
Keep it.
It suits you.

1008
01:22:07,599 --> 01:22:10,051
You're a good man, Finn.

1009
01:22:10,076 --> 01:22:12,737
Poe, I need your help.

1010
01:22:13,771 --> 01:22:17,307
<i>PZ-4CO,
report to communications.</i>

1011
01:22:19,694 --> 01:22:21,578
General Organa...

1012
01:22:22,530 --> 01:22:24,782
I'm sorry to interrupt.
This is Finn.

1013
01:22:24,783 --> 01:22:27,701
- He needs to talk to you.
- And I need to talk to him.

1014
01:22:27,702 --> 01:22:29,578
That was incredibly brave what you did.

1015
01:22:29,578 --> 01:22:32,076
Renouncing the First Order,
saving this man's life.

1016
01:22:32,100 --> 01:22:34,088
Thank you, ma'am. But a friend
of mine was taken prisoner.

1017
01:22:34,113 --> 01:22:36,252
Han told me about the girl.

1018
01:22:36,252 --> 01:22:37,337
I'm sorry.

1019
01:22:37,363 --> 01:22:39,630
Finn's familiar with the weapon
that destroyed the Hosnian system.

1020
01:22:39,631 --> 01:22:41,131
He worked on the base.

1021
01:22:41,132 --> 01:22:42,989
We're desperate for anything
you can tell us.

1022
01:22:43,015 --> 01:22:45,631
That's where my friend was taken.
I've got to get there fast.

1023
01:22:45,657 --> 01:22:47,470
And I will do everything I can to help...

1024
01:22:47,471 --> 01:22:50,382
but first you need to tell us
all you know.

1025
01:22:52,685 --> 01:22:55,095
That sounds very scary.

1026
01:22:56,523 --> 01:22:59,350
You must be so brave.

1027
01:23:01,485 --> 01:23:04,070
General.
I regret to inform you...

1028
01:23:04,072 --> 01:23:07,365
but this map recovered from BB-8
is only partially complete.

1029
01:23:07,367 --> 01:23:11,203
And even worse, it matches
no charted system on record.

1030
01:23:11,203 --> 01:23:13,413
We simply do not have
enough information

1031
01:23:13,414 --> 01:23:15,615
to locate Master Luke.

1032
01:23:15,640 --> 01:23:18,085
Can't believe I was so foolish
to think I could find Luke...

1033
01:23:18,086 --> 01:23:19,211
and bring him home.

1034
01:23:19,212 --> 01:23:20,421
Leia.

1035
01:23:20,421 --> 01:23:21,588
Don't do that.

1036
01:23:21,590 --> 01:23:22,881
Do what?

1037
01:23:22,882 --> 01:23:24,708
Anything.

1038
01:23:25,265 --> 01:23:27,265
Princesses.

1039
01:23:27,429 --> 01:23:29,895
I'm trying to be helpful.

1040
01:23:29,921 --> 01:23:31,306
Huh.
When did that ever help?

1041
01:23:31,307 --> 01:23:33,717
And don't say the Death Star.

1042
01:23:40,164 --> 01:23:42,712
R2, I need you help.

1043
01:23:46,969 --> 01:23:48,216
R2, wake up.

1044
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:49,365
BB-8.

1045
01:23:49,367 --> 01:23:52,270
- You're wasting your time.
- He might have the other map.

1046
01:23:52,295 --> 01:23:54,033
It is very doubtful that R2 would have

1047
01:23:54,057 --> 01:23:55,747
the rest of the map
in his backup data.

1048
01:23:55,748 --> 01:23:57,957
- Can't we wake him?
- I am afraid not.

1049
01:23:57,958 --> 01:24:02,704
R2-D2 has been in low-power mode
ever since Master Luke went away.

1050
01:24:04,591 --> 01:24:08,251
Sadly, he may never be
his old self again.

1051
01:24:08,275 --> 01:24:09,529
Poor R2.

1052
01:24:09,554 --> 01:24:11,881
Listen to me, will you?

1053
01:24:12,181 --> 01:24:14,912
I know every time you...

1054
01:24:16,728 --> 01:24:19,188
Every time you look at me
you're reminded of him.

1055
01:24:19,189 --> 01:24:21,273
You think I want to forget him?

1056
01:24:21,274 --> 01:24:23,067
I want him back.

1057
01:24:23,068 --> 01:24:25,853
There's nothing more we could
have done.

1058
01:24:26,904 --> 01:24:28,363
There's too much Vader in him.

1059
01:24:28,364 --> 01:24:31,367
That's why I wanted him
to train with Luke.

1060
01:24:31,368 --> 01:24:33,159
I just never should have
sent him away.

1061
01:24:33,161 --> 01:24:35,445
That's when I lost him.

1062
01:24:35,997 --> 01:24:38,698
That's when I lost you both.

1063
01:24:40,085 --> 01:24:43,453
We both had to deal with it
in our own way.

1064
01:24:43,755 --> 01:24:47,298
I went back to the only thing
I was ever any good at.

1065
01:24:47,300 --> 01:24:49,210
We both did.

1066
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,554
We lost our son.

1067
01:24:52,555 --> 01:24:53,805
Forever.

1068
01:24:53,806 --> 01:24:54,931
No.

1069
01:24:54,932 --> 01:24:56,934
It was Snoke.

1070
01:24:56,935 --> 01:24:59,645
He seduced our son to the dark side.

1071
01:24:59,645 --> 01:25:01,930
But we can still save him.

1072
01:25:01,939 --> 01:25:03,765
Me.

1073
01:25:03,984 --> 01:25:05,725
You.

1074
01:25:05,859 --> 01:25:08,279
If Luke couldn't reach him,
how could I?

1075
01:25:08,279 --> 01:25:10,398
Luke is a Jedi.

1076
01:25:11,283 --> 01:25:13,317
You're his father.

1077
01:25:15,328 --> 01:25:19,206
There is still light in him,
I know it.

1078
01:25:19,207 --> 01:25:21,000
General...

1079
01:25:21,001 --> 01:25:24,203
the reconnaissance report
on the enemy base is coming.

1080
01:25:50,322 --> 01:25:52,023
Where am I?

1081
01:25:53,658 --> 01:25:55,074
<i>You're my guest.</i>

1082
01:25:55,076 --> 01:25:56,493
Where are the others?

1083
01:25:56,493 --> 01:25:58,244
<i>Do you mean the murderers...</i>

1084
01:25:58,246 --> 01:26:02,054
<i>traitors, and thieves you call friends?</i>

1085
01:26:02,082 --> 01:26:05,243
<i>You'll be relieved to hear
I have no idea.</i>

1086
01:26:06,546 --> 01:26:09,331
<i>You still want to kill me.</i>

1087
01:26:09,423 --> 01:26:11,175
That happens
when you're being hunted...

1088
01:26:11,176 --> 01:26:13,793
by a creature in a mask.

1089
01:26:38,036 --> 01:26:40,570
Tell me about the droid.

1090
01:26:40,704 --> 01:26:42,622
He's a BB unit with a selenium drive...

1091
01:26:42,623 --> 01:26:44,041
and a thermal hyperscan vindicator.

1092
01:26:44,042 --> 01:26:46,251
It's carrying a section
of a navigational chart.

1093
01:26:46,252 --> 01:26:47,711
And we have the rest.

1094
01:26:47,712 --> 01:26:49,587
Recovered from the archives
of the Empire...

1095
01:26:49,588 --> 01:26:50,756
but we need the last piece.

1096
01:26:50,756 --> 01:26:53,917
And somehow you convinced
the droid to show it to you.

1097
01:26:54,844 --> 01:26:56,545
You.

1098
01:26:57,305 --> 01:26:59,256
A scavenger.

1099
01:27:00,891 --> 01:27:03,719
You know I can take whatever I want.

1100
01:27:09,149 --> 01:27:11,769
You're so lonely.

1101
01:27:13,070 --> 01:27:15,271
So afraid to leave.

1102
01:27:18,743 --> 01:27:22,363
At night, desperate to sleep.

1103
01:27:24,791 --> 01:27:27,076
You imagine an ocean.

1104
01:27:27,335 --> 01:27:29,328
I see it.

1105
01:27:29,878 --> 01:27:32,331
I see the island.

1106
01:27:36,219 --> 01:27:38,212
And Han Solo.

1107
01:27:39,847 --> 01:27:42,640
You feel like he's the father
you never had.

1108
01:27:42,641 --> 01:27:44,268
He would have disappointed you.

1109
01:27:44,269 --> 01:27:46,261
Get out of my head.

1110
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:48,930
I know you've seen the map.

1111
01:27:49,815 --> 01:27:51,684
It's in there.

1112
01:27:51,900 --> 01:27:53,853
And now you'll give it to me.

1113
01:28:01,786 --> 01:28:04,529
Don't be afraid. I feel it, too.

1114
01:28:06,291 --> 01:28:09,417
I'm not giving you anything.

1115
01:28:09,418 --> 01:28:11,203
We'll see.

1116
01:28:50,502 --> 01:28:52,203
You.

1117
01:28:52,587 --> 01:28:54,287
You're afraid.

1118
01:28:56,632 --> 01:29:00,252
That you will never be
as strong as Darth Vader.

1119
01:29:08,728 --> 01:29:10,686
<i>The scavenger...</i>

1120
01:29:10,688 --> 01:29:12,396
resisted you?

1121
01:29:12,398 --> 01:29:14,065
She is strong with the Force.

1122
01:29:14,067 --> 01:29:15,943
Untrained, but stronger than she knows.

1123
01:29:15,944 --> 01:29:17,235
And the droid?

1124
01:29:17,237 --> 01:29:20,655
Ren believed it was no longer
valuable to us.

1125
01:29:20,657 --> 01:29:23,408
That the girl was all we needed.

1126
01:29:23,408 --> 01:29:25,953
As a result, the droid has
most likely been returned...

1127
01:29:25,953 --> 01:29:27,203
to the hands of the enemy.

1128
01:29:27,204 --> 01:29:28,997
They may have the map already.

1129
01:29:28,997 --> 01:29:30,748
Then the Resistance
must be destroyed...

1130
01:29:30,750 --> 01:29:32,833
before they get to Skywalker.

1131
01:29:32,835 --> 01:29:34,795
We have their location.

1132
01:29:34,796 --> 01:29:38,122
We tracked their reconnaissance ship
to the Ileenium system.

1133
01:29:38,423 --> 01:29:39,800
Good.

1134
01:29:39,801 --> 01:29:42,761
Then we will crush them
once and for all.

1135
01:29:42,761 --> 01:29:45,137
Prepare the weapon.

1136
01:29:45,139 --> 01:29:48,015
Supreme Leader, I can get
the map from the girl.

1137
01:29:48,016 --> 01:29:50,511
I just need your guidance.

1138
01:29:51,436 --> 01:29:56,149
If what you say about this girl is true...

1139
01:29:56,149 --> 01:30:01,521
Bring her to me.

1140
01:30:14,793 --> 01:30:17,045
You will remove these restraints...

1141
01:30:17,046 --> 01:30:20,832
and leave this cell with the door open.

1142
01:30:23,886 --> 01:30:26,337
<i>What did you say?</i>

1143
01:30:28,557 --> 01:30:30,141
You will remove these restraints...

1144
01:30:30,143 --> 01:30:33,511
and leave this cell with the door open.

1145
01:30:39,652 --> 01:30:41,319
<i>I'll tighten
those restraints...</i>

1146
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:44,064
<i>scavenger scum.</i>

1147
01:30:57,670 --> 01:30:59,337
You will remove these restraints...

1148
01:30:59,338 --> 01:31:02,416
and leave this cell with the door open.

1149
01:31:05,427 --> 01:31:07,095
<i>I will remove
these restraints...</i>

1150
01:31:07,095 --> 01:31:09,547
<i>and leave the cell with the door open.</i>

1151
01:31:17,774 --> 01:31:21,518
- And you'll drop your weapon.
<i>- And I'll drop my weapon.</i>

1152
01:31:33,538 --> 01:31:35,323
<i>No.</i>

1153
01:31:35,625 --> 01:31:37,326
<i>No.</i>

1154
01:31:38,543 --> 01:31:40,371
<i>Guards!</i>

1155
01:31:42,215 --> 01:31:43,916
<i>Guards!</i>

1156
01:31:48,220 --> 01:31:50,555
Begin charging the weapon.

1157
01:31:50,555 --> 01:31:51,972
Yes, sir.

1158
01:31:51,974 --> 01:31:53,966
Weapon charging.

1159
01:32:12,537 --> 01:32:14,621
The scan data from Snap's
reconnaissance flight...

1160
01:32:14,622 --> 01:32:16,081
confirms Finn's report.

1161
01:32:16,082 --> 01:32:18,125
They've somehow created
a hyper-lightspeed weapon...

1162
01:32:18,126 --> 01:32:19,583
built within the planet itself.

1163
01:32:19,585 --> 01:32:20,627
A laser cannon?

1164
01:32:20,627 --> 01:32:22,587
We're not sure how to describe
a weapon of this scale.

1165
01:32:22,587 --> 01:32:23,671
It's another Death Star.

1166
01:32:23,672 --> 01:32:25,506
I wish that were the case, Major.

1167
01:32:25,507 --> 01:32:27,684
This was the Death Star.

1168
01:32:29,511 --> 01:32:32,514
And this is Starkiller Base.

1169
01:32:32,515 --> 01:32:33,765
So, it's big.

1170
01:32:33,765 --> 01:32:36,976
How is it possible to power
a weapon of that size?

1171
01:32:36,978 --> 01:32:39,805
It uses the power of the sun.

1172
01:32:40,314 --> 01:32:41,605
As the weapon is charged...

1173
01:32:41,606 --> 01:32:43,578
the sun is drained
until it disappears.

1174
01:32:43,603 --> 01:32:45,304
Ma'am.

1175
01:32:46,779 --> 01:32:47,945
The First Order...

1176
01:32:47,947 --> 01:32:50,064
they're charging the weapon again now.

1177
01:32:50,323 --> 01:32:52,324
Our system is the next target.

1178
01:32:52,326 --> 01:32:53,409
Oh, my.

1179
01:32:53,411 --> 01:32:54,994
Without the Republic fleet,
we're doomed.

1180
01:32:54,996 --> 01:32:56,872
Okay.
How do we blow it up?

1181
01:32:56,872 --> 01:32:59,291
- There's always a way to do that.
- Han's right.

1182
01:32:59,292 --> 01:33:01,042
In order
for that amount of power...

1183
01:33:01,042 --> 01:33:02,502
to be contained...

1184
01:33:02,502 --> 01:33:04,587
that base has to have some
kind of thermal oscillator.

1185
01:33:04,588 --> 01:33:07,340
There is one. Precinct 47.

1186
01:33:07,341 --> 01:33:08,675
Here.

1187
01:33:08,676 --> 01:33:10,761
If we can destroy
that oscillator...

1188
01:33:10,761 --> 01:33:13,805
it might destabilize the core
and cripple the weapon.

1189
01:33:13,805 --> 01:33:15,681
- Maybe the planet.
- We'll go in there,

1190
01:33:15,682 --> 01:33:17,141
we'll hit that oscillator
with everything we've got.

1191
01:33:17,143 --> 01:33:18,560
They have defensive shields...

1192
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:20,645
that our ships cannot penetrate.

1193
01:33:20,645 --> 01:33:22,146
We disable the shields.

1194
01:33:22,148 --> 01:33:23,939
Kid, you worked there.

1195
01:33:23,940 --> 01:33:25,024
What do you got?

1196
01:33:25,025 --> 01:33:26,318
I can do it.

1197
01:33:26,319 --> 01:33:27,694
I like this guy.

1198
01:33:27,694 --> 01:33:29,654
I can disable the shields,
but I have to be there.

1199
01:33:29,654 --> 01:33:31,198
On the planet.

1200
01:33:31,198 --> 01:33:33,524
- We'll get you there.
- Han, how?

1201
01:33:33,576 --> 01:33:35,202
If I told you, you wouldn't like it.

1202
01:33:35,203 --> 01:33:37,162
So we disable the shields...

1203
01:33:37,162 --> 01:33:39,581
we take out the oscillator
and we blow up their big gun.

1204
01:33:39,582 --> 01:33:42,367
All right. Let's go.

1205
01:34:04,189 --> 01:34:05,774
Chewie, check that donal capitator.

1206
01:34:05,774 --> 01:34:07,359
Come on.
Let's go.

1207
01:34:07,359 --> 01:34:09,694
Finn, be careful with those.
They're explosives.

1208
01:34:09,694 --> 01:34:10,862
Now you tell me?

1209
01:34:10,863 --> 01:34:14,774
You know, no matter
how much we fought...

1210
01:34:15,493 --> 01:34:17,911
I've always hated watching you leave.

1211
01:34:17,912 --> 01:34:19,820
That's why I did it.

1212
01:34:20,372 --> 01:34:22,573
So you'd miss me.

1213
01:34:24,627 --> 01:34:27,119
I did miss you.

1214
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:29,756
It wasn't all bad, was it?

1215
01:34:29,756 --> 01:34:30,923
Huh?

1216
01:34:30,925 --> 01:34:34,219
Some of it was... good.

1217
01:34:34,220 --> 01:34:36,587
Pretty good.

1218
01:34:39,225 --> 01:34:42,644
- Some things never change.
- True.

1219
01:34:42,645 --> 01:34:45,346
You still drive me crazy.

1220
01:34:53,823 --> 01:34:56,440
If you see our son...

1221
01:34:58,243 --> 01:35:00,612
bring him home.

1222
01:35:05,333 --> 01:35:08,086
<i>Sir, sensors
triggered in Hangar</i> 7<i>18.</i>

1223
01:35:08,087 --> 01:35:09,837
<i>We're searching the area.</i>

1224
01:35:09,838 --> 01:35:12,090
<i>She's just beginning
to test her powers.</i>

1225
01:35:12,091 --> 01:35:13,841
<i>The longer it takes to find her...</i>

1226
01:35:13,842 --> 01:35:16,211
<i>the more dangerous she becomes.</i>

1227
01:35:20,600 --> 01:35:22,309
<i>All sentry droids...</i>

1228
01:35:22,310 --> 01:35:23,601
<i>all sentry droids...</i>

1229
01:35:23,603 --> 01:35:25,936
<i>resynchronize
to Galactic Standard Time.</i>

1230
01:35:25,938 --> 01:35:28,640
<i>Offset 4</i>7<i>3.</i>

1231
01:35:30,693 --> 01:35:31,902
How are we getting in?

1232
01:35:31,903 --> 01:35:33,944
Their shields have
a fractional refresh rate.

1233
01:35:33,945 --> 01:35:35,779
Keeps anything traveling
slower than lightspeed...

1234
01:35:35,780 --> 01:35:37,698
from getting through.

1235
01:35:37,699 --> 01:35:40,484
We're making our landing
approach at lightspeed?

1236
01:35:41,244 --> 01:35:43,029
Chewie, get ready.

1237
01:35:43,622 --> 01:35:45,489
And... Now!

1238
01:35:48,711 --> 01:35:51,078
I am pulling up!

1239
01:35:57,094 --> 01:35:58,802
I get any higher...

1240
01:35:58,804 --> 01:36:00,756
they'll see us!

1241
01:36:21,993 --> 01:36:24,496
Sir, she was
not found in Hangar 718.

1242
01:36:24,497 --> 01:36:25,663
But all troops are on alert.

1243
01:36:25,664 --> 01:36:27,164
<i>Put every hangar on lockdown.</i>

1244
01:36:27,166 --> 01:36:29,533
<i>She's going to try to steal
a ship to esc...</i>

1245
01:36:31,462 --> 01:36:33,704
<i>Han Solo.</i>

1246
01:36:44,225 --> 01:36:46,016
The flooding tunnel is over that ridge.

1247
01:36:46,018 --> 01:36:47,351
We'll get in that way.

1248
01:36:47,353 --> 01:36:49,354
What was your job
when you were based here?

1249
01:36:49,354 --> 01:36:51,055
Sanitation.

1250
01:36:53,234 --> 01:36:55,025
Sanitation?

1251
01:36:55,027 --> 01:36:56,860
Then how do you know
how to disable the shields?

1252
01:36:56,862 --> 01:36:57,988
I don't.

1253
01:36:57,988 --> 01:36:59,863
I'm just here to get Rey.

1254
01:36:59,864 --> 01:37:03,534
People are counting on us.
The galaxy is counting on us.

1255
01:37:03,536 --> 01:37:05,805
Solo, we'll figure it out.

1256
01:37:05,829 --> 01:37:07,372
We'll use the Force.

1257
01:37:07,372 --> 01:37:09,722
That's not how the Force works.

1258
01:37:09,747 --> 01:37:11,073
I'm cold.

1259
01:37:11,097 --> 01:37:13,297
Oh, really?
You're cold?

1260
01:37:13,323 --> 01:37:15,024
Come on.

1261
01:37:22,179 --> 01:37:23,555
Report.

1262
01:37:23,555 --> 01:37:26,466
Weapon charged in 15 minutes, sir.

1263
01:37:28,226 --> 01:37:29,927
<i>Hey!</i>

1264
01:37:32,398 --> 01:37:34,733
The longer we're here
the less luck we're gonna have.

1265
01:37:34,734 --> 01:37:37,935
- The shields.
- I have an idea about that.

1266
01:37:45,202 --> 01:37:47,746
- You remember me?
<i>- FN-218</i>7.

1267
01:37:47,747 --> 01:37:49,163
Not anymore.

1268
01:37:49,164 --> 01:37:50,582
The name's Finn and I'm in charge.

1269
01:37:50,582 --> 01:37:52,708
I'm in charge now, Phasma.
I'm in charge.

1270
01:37:52,710 --> 01:37:54,793
- Bring it down. Bring it down.
- Yeah.

1271
01:37:54,795 --> 01:37:56,621
Follow me.

1272
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:10,643
<i>Have you
checked out the new T-1</i>7<i>s?</i>

1273
01:38:10,644 --> 01:38:12,436
<i>The T-1</i>7<i>s,
as far as I can tell...</i>

1274
01:38:12,438 --> 01:38:13,604
<i>are a great improvement.</i>

1275
01:38:13,605 --> 01:38:15,564
<i>Yeah.
That's what they tell you.</i>

1276
01:38:15,565 --> 01:38:16,899
<i>But believe me, they don't hold up.</i>

1277
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:19,101
<i>- They don't?
- No.</i>

1278
01:38:53,730 --> 01:38:55,939
You want me to blast
that bucket off your head?

1279
01:38:55,939 --> 01:38:57,148
Lower the shields.

1280
01:38:57,149 --> 01:38:59,109
<i>You're making a big mistake.</i>

1281
01:38:59,109 --> 01:39:01,895
- Do it.
- Do as he says.

1282
01:39:05,225 --> 01:39:06,658
Solo, if this works...

1283
01:39:06,658 --> 01:39:08,993
we're not gonna have
a lot of time to find Rey.

1284
01:39:08,993 --> 01:39:11,070
Don't worry, kid.

1285
01:39:11,162 --> 01:39:13,475
We won't leave here without her.

1286
01:39:14,375 --> 01:39:17,335
<i>You can't be so stupid
as to think this will be easy.</i>

1287
01:39:17,336 --> 01:39:20,003
<i>My troops will storm
this block and kill you all.</i>

1288
01:39:20,005 --> 01:39:22,465
I disagree.
What do we do with her?

1289
01:39:22,466 --> 01:39:24,676
Is there a garbage chute?

1290
01:39:24,676 --> 01:39:26,711
Trash compactor?

1291
01:39:27,037 --> 01:39:28,434
Yeah, there is.

1292
01:39:28,458 --> 01:39:30,222
General, their shields are down.

1293
01:39:30,224 --> 01:39:31,890
Thank the Maker!

1294
01:39:31,891 --> 01:39:33,725
Han did it.
Send them in.

1295
01:39:33,726 --> 01:39:35,728
Give Poe full authorization for attack.

1296
01:39:35,729 --> 01:39:38,105
Black Leader,
go to sub-lights on your call.

1297
01:39:38,106 --> 01:39:40,739
Roger, base.
Red squad, Blue squad, take my lead.

1298
01:39:40,765 --> 01:39:43,621
- Copy that.
- Dropping out of lightspeed.

1299
01:39:56,832 --> 01:39:58,500
<i>Almost in range.</i>

1300
01:39:58,524 --> 01:40:01,359
Hit the target dead center.
As many runs as we can get.

1301
01:40:01,380 --> 01:40:04,123
- Approaching target.
- Let's do this.

1302
01:40:07,219 --> 01:40:09,378
Fighters incoming!

1303
01:40:09,555 --> 01:40:11,221
<i>Coming at 28.336.</i>

1304
01:40:11,222 --> 01:40:13,099
Forty-five!
Shields up! Shields up!

1305
01:40:13,100 --> 01:40:14,893
Dispatch all squadrons.

1306
01:40:14,894 --> 01:40:16,577
Yes, General.

1307
01:40:16,895 --> 01:40:18,804
All right.
Let's light it up.

1308
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:30,158
- Ah, direct hit.
- But no damage!

1309
01:40:30,158 --> 01:40:31,576
<i>Yeah, we gotta
keep hitting it.</i>

1310
01:40:31,577 --> 01:40:32,993
Another bombing run.

1311
01:40:32,994 --> 01:40:35,787
<i>Remember, when the sun is gone
that weapon will be ready to fire.</i>

1312
01:40:35,788 --> 01:40:39,074
But as long as there's light,
we got a chance.

1313
01:40:39,100 --> 01:40:42,451
- Oh, no. Enemy fighters!
- Guys, we got a lot of company!

1314
01:40:48,260 --> 01:40:49,969
<i>We think
they may be splitting up.</i>

1315
01:40:49,970 --> 01:40:52,631
<i>Heading to quadrants 4 and 5.</i>

1316
01:40:59,771 --> 01:41:01,855
We'll use the charges
to blow that blast door.

1317
01:41:01,856 --> 01:41:04,692
I'll go in and draw fire,
but I'm gonna need cover.

1318
01:41:04,693 --> 01:41:05,859
You sure you're up for this?

1319
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:07,153
Hell, no.

1320
01:41:07,154 --> 01:41:08,529
I'll go in and try to find Rey.

1321
01:41:08,529 --> 01:41:09,822
The troopers will be on our tail.

1322
01:41:09,823 --> 01:41:12,033
We have to be ready for that.

1323
01:41:12,033 --> 01:41:13,909
There's an access tunnel that leads...

1324
01:41:13,911 --> 01:41:16,537
Why are you doing that? Hmm?
Why are you doing this?

1325
01:41:16,537 --> 01:41:18,573
I'm trying to come up with a plan.

1326
01:41:34,597 --> 01:41:36,265
You all right?

1327
01:41:36,266 --> 01:41:37,975
- Yeah.
- Good.

1328
01:41:37,976 --> 01:41:39,644
What happened to you?
Did he hurt you?

1329
01:41:39,645 --> 01:41:41,145
Finn, what are you doing here?

1330
01:41:41,145 --> 01:41:43,931
We came back for you.

1331
01:41:44,108 --> 01:41:45,733
What'd he say?

1332
01:41:45,734 --> 01:41:47,810
That it was your idea.

1333
01:41:50,905 --> 01:41:52,690
Thank you.

1334
01:41:55,868 --> 01:41:57,537
How did you get away?

1335
01:41:57,537 --> 01:41:58,662
I can't explain it.

1336
01:41:58,663 --> 01:42:00,832
And you wouldn't believe it.

1337
01:42:00,832 --> 01:42:03,868
Escape now, hug later.

1338
01:42:18,350 --> 01:42:20,018
I got one behind me.

1339
01:42:20,019 --> 01:42:22,095
<i>- You see it?</i>
- Yeah. I'm on it.

1340
01:42:30,029 --> 01:42:32,564
- Burillo's been hit.
- Watch out for ground fire.

1341
01:42:36,784 --> 01:42:38,828
They're in trouble.

1342
01:42:38,828 --> 01:42:40,947
We can't leave.

1343
01:42:42,041 --> 01:42:45,126
My friend's got a bag
full of explosives.

1344
01:42:45,127 --> 01:42:46,877
Let's use them.

1345
01:42:46,878 --> 01:42:48,378
General, are you seeing this?

1346
01:42:48,380 --> 01:42:49,796
Two more X-wings down.

1347
01:42:49,797 --> 01:42:52,257
That's half our fleet destroyed.

1348
01:42:52,259 --> 01:42:55,011
And their weapon
will be fully charged in ten minutes.

1349
01:42:55,011 --> 01:42:57,838
It would take a miracle
to save us now.

1350
01:43:23,582 --> 01:43:24,664
Ah.

1351
01:43:24,666 --> 01:43:27,702
Girl knows her stuff.

1352
01:43:35,969 --> 01:43:39,130
We'll set the charges
against every other column.

1353
01:43:39,640 --> 01:43:41,681
You're right.
That's a better idea.

1354
01:43:41,682 --> 01:43:43,768
You take the top.
I'll go down below.

1355
01:43:43,769 --> 01:43:45,520
Detonator.

1356
01:43:45,520 --> 01:43:47,889
We'll meet back here.

1357
01:44:32,609 --> 01:44:34,310
<i>Find them.</i>

1358
01:45:35,380 --> 01:45:37,081
Ben!

1359
01:45:49,144 --> 01:45:50,970
<i>Han Solo.</i>

1360
01:45:50,979 --> 01:45:54,556
<i>I've been waiting for this day
for a long time.</i>

1361
01:46:13,126 --> 01:46:17,212
Take off that mask. You don't need it.

1362
01:46:17,213 --> 01:46:19,215
<i>What do you think you'll see if I do?</i>

1363
01:46:19,216 --> 01:46:22,167
The face of my son.

1364
01:46:43,323 --> 01:46:46,192
Your son is gone.

1365
01:46:46,784 --> 01:46:49,287
He was weak and foolish
like his father.

1366
01:46:49,287 --> 01:46:51,738
So I destroyed him.

1367
01:46:53,125 --> 01:46:56,202
That's what Snoke
wants you to believe.

1368
01:46:56,752 --> 01:46:59,162
But it's not true.

1369
01:46:59,797 --> 01:47:01,966
My son is alive.

1370
01:47:01,966 --> 01:47:03,509
No.

1371
01:47:03,510 --> 01:47:05,802
The Supreme Leader is wise.

1372
01:47:05,804 --> 01:47:08,639
Snoke is using you for your power.

1373
01:47:08,640 --> 01:47:11,134
When he gets what he wants,
he'll crush you.

1374
01:47:15,689 --> 01:47:18,056
You know it's true.

1375
01:47:22,988 --> 01:47:24,070
It's too late.

1376
01:47:24,072 --> 01:47:25,739
No, it's not.

1377
01:47:25,740 --> 01:47:28,192
Leave here with me.
Come home.

1378
01:47:29,243 --> 01:47:31,362
We miss you.

1379
01:47:39,378 --> 01:47:42,206
I'm being torn apart.

1380
01:47:44,342 --> 01:47:47,211
I want to be free of this pain.

1381
01:47:51,932 --> 01:47:53,059
I know what I have to do...

1382
01:47:53,060 --> 01:47:55,886
but I don't know if I have
the strength to do it.

1383
01:47:59,106 --> 01:48:00,274
Will you help me?

1384
01:48:00,274 --> 01:48:02,810
Yes.
Anything.

1385
01:48:50,403 --> 01:48:52,685
NOOOO !!

1386
01:48:52,711 --> 01:48:54,381
No!

1387
01:49:00,167 --> 01:49:02,119
Thank you.

1388
01:49:08,926 --> 01:49:11,640
No!
No.

1389
01:50:25,252 --> 01:50:28,756
The oscillator's been damaged
but is still functional.

1390
01:50:28,756 --> 01:50:31,958
Admiral, their weapon
will fire in two minutes.

1391
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:44,680
The <i>Falcon's</i> this way.

1392
01:51:04,876 --> 01:51:06,911
We're not done yet.

1393
01:51:09,381 --> 01:51:11,340
You're a monster.

1394
01:51:11,341 --> 01:51:13,917
It's just us now.

1395
01:51:14,386 --> 01:51:16,587
Han Solo can't save you.

1396
01:51:24,688 --> 01:51:27,180
Rey!

1397
01:51:29,275 --> 01:51:30,859
Rey.

1398
01:51:30,860 --> 01:51:32,561
Rey!

1399
01:51:33,697 --> 01:51:35,405
Oh, no. No, no.

1400
01:51:35,407 --> 01:51:37,108
Rey.

1401
01:51:38,618 --> 01:51:40,860
Traitor!

1402
01:51:50,713 --> 01:51:52,957
That lightsaber.

1403
01:51:53,382 --> 01:51:54,661
It belongs to me.

1404
01:51:54,685 --> 01:51:56,881
Come get it.

1405
01:53:43,993 --> 01:53:45,703
We just lost <i>R-1.</i>

1406
01:53:45,703 --> 01:53:47,078
<i>We're overwhelmed.</i>

1407
01:53:47,079 --> 01:53:49,073
What do we do?
It isn't working.

1408
01:53:49,123 --> 01:53:52,033
Black Leader, there's a brand
new hole in that oscillator.

1409
01:53:52,377 --> 01:53:54,920
<i>Looks like our friends got in.</i>

1410
01:53:54,921 --> 01:53:56,880
Red Four, Red Six, cover us.

1411
01:53:56,881 --> 01:53:58,131
- I'm on it.
- Roger.

1412
01:53:58,132 --> 01:53:59,757
Everybody else, hit the target hard.

1413
01:53:59,759 --> 01:54:01,502
Give it everything you got.

1414
01:54:13,689 --> 01:54:15,149
I need some help here.
I need some help!

1415
01:54:15,149 --> 01:54:17,391
- Coming in!
- Watch out!

1416
01:54:17,443 --> 01:54:19,395
I'm hit!

1417
01:54:24,367 --> 01:54:26,409
All teams, I'm going in.

1418
01:54:26,411 --> 01:54:27,661
<i>Pull up and cover me.</i>

1419
01:54:27,662 --> 01:54:30,318
Copy that, Black Leader.
Good luck, Poe.

1420
01:54:35,545 --> 01:54:38,122
Weapon fully charged in 30 seconds.

1421
01:54:38,922 --> 01:54:40,791
Prepare to fire.

1422
01:54:51,802 --> 01:54:53,262
*Fuel cell

1423
01:54:54,820 --> 01:54:56,033
*Fuel cell

1424
01:54:56,278 --> 01:54:57,355
*Fuel cell

1425
01:54:59,127 --> 01:55:00,733
*Fuel cell

1426
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:15,301
You need a teacher.

1427
01:56:16,479 --> 01:56:18,972
I could show you
the ways of the Force.

1428
01:56:20,769 --> 01:56:22,554
The Force?

1429
01:58:10,760 --> 01:58:12,261
All eyes on that TIE fighter.

1430
01:58:12,261 --> 01:58:14,546
We're losing power rapidly!

1431
01:58:16,224 --> 01:58:18,225
Lieutenant!
Get back to your station!

1432
01:58:18,225 --> 01:58:21,645
Just look! We won't survive.
Even Hux is gone.

1433
01:58:21,645 --> 01:58:23,846
Supreme Leader.

1434
01:58:24,023 --> 01:58:26,065
The fuel cells have ruptured.

1435
01:58:26,067 --> 01:58:28,402
The collapse of the planet has begun.

1436
01:58:28,403 --> 01:58:33,148
Leave the base at once
and come to me with Kylo Ren.

1437
01:58:33,533 --> 01:58:38,529
It is time...
to complete his training.

1438
01:58:40,163 --> 01:58:41,864
Finn!

1439
01:58:41,916 --> 01:58:43,826
Finn.

1440
01:59:32,257 --> 01:59:36,045
- All teams, I got eyes on them.
- Yes!

1441
01:59:58,283 --> 02:00:02,112
Our job's done here.
Let's go home.

1442
02:00:16,594 --> 02:00:19,054
Easy, easy.
He's hurt.

1443
02:00:19,055 --> 02:00:20,963
We've got a heartbeat.

1444
02:01:17,037 --> 02:01:18,172
R2?

1445
02:01:18,198 --> 02:01:19,927
Yay!
You are awake.

1446
02:01:19,953 --> 02:01:21,840
BB-8.
It's nice to see you again.

1447
02:01:21,864 --> 02:01:23,088
Me too.
Me too.

1448
02:01:23,113 --> 02:01:24,804
R2-D2!

1449
02:01:24,828 --> 02:01:26,649
You've come back.

1450
02:01:26,673 --> 02:01:29,766
I've been scanning my backup data.
And I think I've found it.

1451
02:01:29,792 --> 02:01:31,502
- You found what?
- You're a dumb circuit.

1452
02:01:31,527 --> 02:01:33,927
How dare you call me that!

1453
02:01:33,953 --> 02:01:36,019
Enough of that.
We have to go find Master Luke.

1454
02:01:36,043 --> 02:01:37,969
- Find Master Luke, how?
- I might have the map.

1455
02:01:37,993 --> 02:01:41,712
Come, R2. We must go
tell the others at once!

1456
02:01:42,345 --> 02:01:43,512
General.

1457
02:01:43,514 --> 02:01:45,676
Excuse me, General.

1458
02:01:45,701 --> 02:01:50,246
Hello, General, it's me, R2-D2.
Quickly, C-3PO, tell her of my findings.

1459
02:01:50,270 --> 02:01:53,439
R2 may contain some
much-needed good news.

1460
02:01:53,440 --> 02:01:55,269
Tell me.

1461
02:02:03,690 --> 02:02:05,261
Poe, I need your map too.

1462
02:02:05,286 --> 02:02:07,404
Yeah. All right, buddy.
Hold on.

1463
02:02:21,135 --> 02:02:23,386
The map, it is complete.

1464
02:02:23,386 --> 02:02:25,137
Luke.

1465
02:02:25,139 --> 02:02:26,847
Oh, my dear friend...

1466
02:02:26,849 --> 02:02:29,841
- how I've missed you.
- Well, I missed you too.

1467
02:02:45,368 --> 02:02:47,493
We'll see each other again.

1468
02:02:47,494 --> 02:02:50,113
I believe that.

1469
02:02:57,587 --> 02:03:00,082
Thank you, my friend.

02:03:14,271 --> 02:03:16,315
Rey.

1471
02:03:17,774 --> 02:03:20,537
May the Force be with you.

1472
02:03:23,510 --> 02:03:28,060
Mistress.
I hope you'll come back soon.

1473
02:04:44,828 --> 02:04:46,823
Good luck!

1474
02:04:47,636 --> 02:04:51,109
Yes, please find master Luke!

1475
02:07:08,532 --> 02:07:13,619
