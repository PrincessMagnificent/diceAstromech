88
00:01:11,234 --> 00:11:11,111
I have seen the face of sorrow.
She looks away in the distance.

1
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,846
This will begin to make things right.

2
00:02:59,764 --> 00:03:02,750
I've traveled too far and seen too much

3
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,812
to ignore the despair in the galaxy.

4
00:03:05,937 --> 00:03:09,774
Without the Jedi, there can be
no balance in the Force.

5
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:13,151
Well, because of you,
now we have a chance.

6
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:15,028
The General's been after this
for a long time.

7
00:03:15,487 --> 00:03:16,889
Oh, the General?

8
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,366
To me, she is royalty.

9
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:21,352
Well, she certainly is that.

10
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,376
We got company.

11
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,973
You have to hide.

12
00:03:43,098 --> 00:03:44,516
You have to leave.

13
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:47,645
Go.

14
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,346
Come on, BB-8, hurry!

15
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:34,716
Blast that X-wing!

16
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:35,985
Over there! Over there!

17
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,117
I see them.

18
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,675
You take this.

19
00:05:15,774 --> 00:05:17,735
It's safer with you than it is with me.

20
00:05:18,569 --> 00:05:20,697
You get as far away from here as you can.

21
00:05:21,863 --> 00:05:23,574
Do you hear me?

22
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,076
I'll come back for you.

23
00:05:25,742 --> 00:05:27,120
It will be all right.

24
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:27,471
Keep moving!

25
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,975
Stay here.

26
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:57,250
Look how old you've become.

27
00:06:57,918 --> 00:07:00,879
Something far worse has happened to you.

28
00:07:01,672 --> 00:07:03,673
You know what I've come for.

29
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,951
I know where you come from.

30
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:08,012
Before you called yourself Kylo Ren.

31
00:07:08,512 --> 00:07:12,098
The map to Skywalker.
We know you found it.

32
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,019
And now you're going
to give it to the First Order.

33
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,588
The First Order rose from the dark side.

34
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:19,689
You did not.

35
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:23,360
I'll show you the dark side.

36
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:25,680
You may try.

37
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:29,783
But you cannot deny
the truth that is your family.

38
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:31,560
You're so right.

39
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,904
So, who talks first?
You talk first? I talk first?

40
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,949
The old man gave it to you.

41
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:12,685
It's just very hard
to understand you with all the...

42
00:08:12,785 --> 00:08:14,411
- Search him.
- ...apparatus.

43
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,334
- Nothing, sir.
- Put him on board.

44
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,968
Sir, the villagers?

45
00:08:31,553 --> 00:08:32,763
Kill them all.

46
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,850
On my command.

47
00:08:36,808 --> 00:08:38,168
Fire.

48
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:40,270
Please, no!

49
00:09:08,758 --> 00:09:10,551
Nothing here. Go ahead!

50
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:52,659
All right.

51
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:53,760
All right!

52
00:10:19,662 --> 00:10:21,371
FN-2187.

53
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,542
Submit your blaster for inspection.

54
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,460
Yes, Captain.

55
00:10:27,003 --> 00:10:29,713
And who gave you permission
to remove that helmet?

56
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,365
I'm sorry, Captain.

57
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,551
Report to my division at once.

58
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:22,510
What you brought me today is worth...

59
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,304
hmm...

60
00:13:25,556 --> 00:13:28,350
one quarter portion.

61
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:28,011
Shh.

62
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:32,349
That's just Teedo. Wants you for parts.

63
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,643
He has no respect for anyone.

64
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:39,440
Your antenna's bent.

65
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,241
Where do you come from?

66
00:15:54,038 --> 00:15:55,813
Classified, really?

67
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:57,206
Me too. Big secret.

68
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:01,211
Niima Outpost is that way.
Stay off Kelvin Ridge.

69
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:03,172
Keep away from
the Sinking Fields in the north.

70
00:16:03,339 --> 00:16:04,756
You'll drown in the sand.

71
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,972
Don't follow me. Town is that way.

72
00:16:16,184 --> 00:16:17,186
No!

73
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,203
In the morning, you go.

74
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,126
You're welcome.

75
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:57,934
I had no idea we had the best pilot
in the Resistance on board.

76
00:17:00,354 --> 00:17:01,355
Comfortable?

77
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:02,940
Not really.

78
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,692
I'm impressed.

79
00:17:08,194 --> 00:17:13,491
No one has been able to get out of you
what you did with the map.

80
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,327
You might want to rethink your technique.

81
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,137
Where is it?

82
00:17:36,097 --> 00:17:39,809
The Resistance...
will not be intimidated by you.

83
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,775
Where... is it?

84
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,480
It's in a droid. A BB unit.

85
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:02,023
Well, then, if it's on Jakku,
we'll soon have it.

86
00:18:02,124 --> 00:18:03,791
I leave that to you.

87
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,614
Don't give up hope.
He still might show up.

88
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,824
Whoever it is you're waiting for.

89
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:12,384
Classified.

90
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,136
I know all about waiting.

91
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,182
For my family.

92
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:21,602
They'll be back. One day.

93
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:23,394
Come on.

94
00:18:26,397 --> 00:18:29,567
These five pieces are worth...

95
00:18:30,402 --> 00:18:32,528
Let me see here... hmm...

96
00:18:32,904 --> 00:18:35,598
one half portion.

97
00:18:35,699 --> 00:18:37,409
Last week they were a half portion each.

98
00:18:37,534 --> 00:18:39,202
What about the droid?

99
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,080
What about him?

100
00:18:43,207 --> 00:18:45,375
I'll pay for him.

101
00:18:51,256 --> 00:18:53,549
Sixty portions.

102
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,563
Actually...

103
00:19:08,565 --> 00:19:10,483
The droid's not for sale.

104
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:13,819
Come on.

105
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,493
Follow the girl and get that droid.

106
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,790
Ren wants the prisoner.

107
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:36,300
Turn here.

108
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:39,246
Listen carefully.

109
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:41,582
If you do exactly as I say,
I can get you out of here.

110
00:19:41,682 --> 00:19:42,682
What?

111
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:46,002
This is a rescue. I'm helping you escape.

112
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:47,837
Can you fly a TIE fighter?

113
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:48,980
You're with the Resistance?

114
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:51,008
What? No, no, no. I'm breaking you out.

115
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:53,109
- Can you fly a TIE fighter?
- I can fly anything.

116
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:56,445
Why? Why are you helping me?

117
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,532
Because it's the right thing to do.

118
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,492
You need a pilot.

119
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:02,952
I need a pilot.

120
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:05,538
We're gonna do this.

121
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:06,873
Yeah?

122
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:13,363
Okay. Stay calm. Stay calm.

123
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,965
- I am calm.
- I'm talking to myself.

124
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:19,469
Not yet.

125
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:23,056
Okay, go. This way.

126
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:31,381
I've always wanted to fly
one of these things.

127
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,549
- Can you shoot?
- Blasters, I can.

128
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,968
Okay, same principle.

129
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,820
Use the toggle on the left to switch
between missiles, cannons and mag pulse.

130
00:20:37,945 --> 00:20:39,364
Use the sight on the right to aim.

131
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,575
- Triggers to fire.
- This is very complicated.

132
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:49,249
I can fix this.

133
00:20:52,586 --> 00:20:55,072
We have an unsanctioned
departure from bay two.

134
00:20:55,172 --> 00:20:57,923
Alert General Hux. And stop that fighter.

135
00:21:18,612 --> 00:21:22,865
- Fourteen failed. Eighteen...
- I got it.

136
00:21:26,787 --> 00:21:28,329
This thing really moves.

137
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:35,086
We gotta take out as many of
these cannons as we can...

138
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:36,279
or we're not gonna get very far.

139
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,780
- All right.
- I'm gonna get us in position.

140
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:38,882
Just stay sharp.

141
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:43,662
Up ahead! Up ahead! You see it?

142
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:44,788
I got us dead center.

143
00:21:44,887 --> 00:21:46,013
- It's a clean shot.
- Okay, got it.

144
00:21:54,772 --> 00:21:56,173
- Yeah!
- Yes!

145
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,342
Did you see that?

146
00:21:57,442 --> 00:21:59,068
- Did you see that?
- I saw it!

147
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,851
Hey, what's your name?

148
00:22:05,951 --> 00:22:07,184
FN-2187.

149
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:08,478
F... What?

150
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:10,413
That's the only name they ever gave me.

151
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,982
Well, I ain't using it. F-N, huh?

152
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:14,567
Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn.

153
00:22:14,667 --> 00:22:16,278
- Is that all right?
- Finn.

154
00:22:16,377 --> 00:22:18,029
Yeah. Finn, I like that.

155
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,281
- I like that.
- I'm Poe. Poe Dameron.

156
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:22,299
- Good to meet you, Poe.
- Good to meet you too, Finn.

157
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,306
Sir, they've taken out our turbolasers.

158
00:22:29,098 --> 00:22:30,474
Use the ventral cannons.

159
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:32,711
Yes, sir. Bringing them online.

160
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,505
General Hux, is it the Resistance pilot?

161
00:22:35,605 --> 00:22:39,483
Yes, and he had help from one of our own.

162
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:43,488
We're checking the registers now
to identify which stormtrooper it was.

163
00:22:43,613 --> 00:22:46,991
The one from the village. FN-2187.

164
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,411
Sir, ventral cannons hot.

165
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:50,953
Fire.

166
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:01,990
One's coming toward you!
My right. Your left.

167
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,842
- Do you see it?
- Hold on.

168
00:23:03,967 --> 00:23:04,968
I see him!

169
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:09,847
Nice shot!

170
00:23:16,188 --> 00:23:17,271
Where are we going?

171
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,522
We're going back to Jakku. That's where.

172
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,174
No. We can't go back to Jakku.

173
00:23:20,275 --> 00:23:21,718
We need to get out of this system.

174
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,694
I gotta get my droid
before the First Order does.

175
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:25,055
- What, a droid?
- That's right.

176
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:27,365
He's a BB unit, orange and white.
One of a kind.

177
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,474
I don't care what color he is!

178
00:23:28,575 --> 00:23:29,809
No droid can be that important.

179
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:30,894
This one is, pal!

180
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:32,662
We gotta get as far away from
the First Order as we can.

181
00:23:32,788 --> 00:23:34,064
We go back to Jakku, we die.

182
00:23:34,163 --> 00:23:36,857
That droid has a map
that leads straight to Luke Skywalker.

183
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:38,876
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

184
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:45,049
FN-2187 reported to my division...

185
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:47,451
was evaluated, and sent to reconditioning.

186
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,788
No prior signs of nonconformity?

187
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,789
This was his first offense.

188
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:52,999
General!

189
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,459
- They've been hit.
- Destroyed?

190
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,794
Disabled.

191
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:57,295
They were headed back to Jakku.

192
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,588
The fighter is projected to crash
in the Goazon badlands.

193
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:01,357
They were going back for the droid.

194
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:03,401
Send a squad to the wreckage.

195
00:24:25,757 --> 00:24:26,924
Poe!

196
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:29,553
Poe!

197
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,429
Poe!

198
00:24:34,891 --> 00:24:36,393
Poe! I got you.

199
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:39,563
Poe!

200
00:24:46,403 --> 00:24:47,444
Poe!

201
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:13,865
Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit.

202
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:16,433
Capture the droid if we can,
but destroy it if we must.

203
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:18,327
How capable are your soldiers, General?

204
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:19,895
I won't have you question my methods.

205
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:22,039
They're obviously skilled
at committing high treason.

206
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:24,960
Perhaps Leader Snoke should
consider using a clone army.

207
00:26:25,085 --> 00:26:26,111
My men are exceptionally trained.

208
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:27,403
Programmed from birth.

209
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:29,780
Then they should have
no problem retrieving the droid.

210
00:26:29,881 --> 00:26:30,882
Unharmed.

211
00:26:31,967 --> 00:26:34,118
Careful, Ren, that your
personal interests...

212
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:36,680
not interfere with orders
from Leader Snoke.

213
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:39,249
I want that map.

214
00:26:39,348 --> 00:26:40,724
For your sake...

215
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:42,059
I suggest you get it.

216
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,800
Water. Water.

217
00:26:49,901 --> 00:26:50,926
No water.

218
00:26:51,027 --> 00:26:52,528
Water.

219
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:55,472
Is there water?

220
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:26,253
What? Oi, get off him!

221
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:36,740
Hey!

222
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:55,174
They work for Unkar.

223
00:27:55,299 --> 00:27:57,035
That guy that wanted you.

224
00:27:57,134 --> 00:27:58,761
He must have really wanted you.

225
00:28:01,138 --> 00:28:03,016
Who?

226
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,102
Him?

227
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:28,083
- What's your hurry, thief?
- What? Thief?

228
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:29,692
Ow!

229
00:28:29,792 --> 00:28:31,068
- Hey, what?
- The jacket.

230
00:28:31,169 --> 00:28:32,670
This droid says you stole it.

231
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,298
I've had a pretty messed up
day, all right?

232
00:28:35,423 --> 00:28:37,842
So I'd appreciate it
if you stop accusing me of...

233
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:40,369
- Ow! Stop it!
- Where'd you get it?

234
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,805
It belongs to his master.

235
00:28:45,099 --> 00:28:48,185
It belonged to Poe Dameron.
That was his name, right?

236
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,856
He was captured by the First Order.

237
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,567
I helped him escape, but our ship crashed.

238
00:28:58,695 --> 00:28:59,823
Poe didn't make it.

239
00:29:04,661 --> 00:29:06,829
I tried to help him. I'm sorry.

240
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,713
So you're with the Resistance?

241
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:22,679
Obviously.

242
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:24,122
Yes, I am.

243
00:29:24,221 --> 00:29:25,515
I'm with the Resistance, yeah.

244
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,683
I am with the Resistance.

245
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:31,311
I've never met
a Resistance fighter before.

246
00:29:32,855 --> 00:29:34,298
Well, this is what we look like.

247
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:36,925
Some of us. Others look different.

248
00:29:37,026 --> 00:29:38,470
BB-8 says he's on a secret mission.

249
00:29:38,569 --> 00:29:40,070
He has to get back to your base.

250
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:44,200
Apparently, he has a map that leads to
Luke Skywalker and everyone's after it.

251
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:46,536
Luke Skywalker?

252
00:29:47,077 --> 00:29:48,579
I thought he was a myth.

253
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:50,874
What?

254
00:29:58,882 --> 00:30:00,424
- What are you doing?
- Come on.

255
00:30:01,718 --> 00:30:02,885
Come on, BB-8!

256
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,723
- Let go of me!
- Come on, we gotta move!

257
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:09,933
I know how to run
without you holding my hand!

258
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,297
BB-8, stay close!

259
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:15,397
This way.

260
00:30:21,195 --> 00:30:22,404
Call in the air strike.

261
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:24,781
Come on!

262
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:27,451
They're shooting at both of us.

263
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,453
Yeah. They saw you with me. You're marked.

264
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:30,980
- Well, thanks for that.
- Hey!

265
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,915
I'm not the one who chased
you down with a stick.

266
00:30:34,209 --> 00:30:35,692
Does anyone have blasters around here?

267
00:30:35,792 --> 00:30:37,319
Are you okay?

268
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:44,301
Stop taking my hand!

269
00:31:00,609 --> 00:31:01,611
Hey.

270
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:05,949
Are you okay?

271
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:08,951
Yeah.

272
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:10,744
Follow me.

273
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:24,909
- We can't outrun them!
- We might in that quadjumper!

274
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:26,344
Hey, we need a pilot!

275
00:31:26,469 --> 00:31:28,011
We've got one.

276
00:31:28,136 --> 00:31:29,137
You?

277
00:31:29,806 --> 00:31:31,749
Uh, what about that ship?

278
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:33,308
That one's garbage!

279
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:40,275
The garbage will do.

280
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:57,875
Gunner position is down there!

281
00:32:01,128 --> 00:32:02,755
You ever fly this thing?

282
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,009
No! This ship hasn't flown in years.

283
00:32:06,174 --> 00:32:07,175
Great.

284
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:12,597
Whoa.

285
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:14,808
I can do this. I can do this.

286
00:32:15,226 --> 00:32:16,853
I can do this. I can do this.

287
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,041
Hey!

288
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,922
That's mine!

289
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:50,094
Wait, stay low! Hey, stay low!

290
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:51,287
- What?
- Stay low!

291
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,596
It confuses their tracking.

292
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:54,891
BB-8, hold on!

293
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:56,433
I'm going low!

294
00:33:15,077 --> 00:33:16,287
What are you doing back there?

295
00:33:16,412 --> 00:33:17,579
Are you ever gonna fire back?

296
00:33:17,747 --> 00:33:19,790
I'm working on it! Are the shields up?

297
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,584
Not so easy without a co-pilot!

298
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,627
Try sitting in this thing.

299
00:33:37,933 --> 00:33:39,268
We need cover, quick!

300
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,711
We're about to get some!

301
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:42,020
I hope.

302
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:09,215
Damn it!

303
00:34:20,184 --> 00:34:21,978
Come on, come on!

304
00:34:24,813 --> 00:34:27,065
- Nice shot!
- I'm getting pretty good at this.

305
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,690
Uh, the cannon's stuck
in forward position.

306
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,458
I can't move it. You gotta lose him!

307
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,840
- Get ready!
- Okay. For what?

308
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:05,771
Are we really doing this?

309
00:35:15,197 --> 00:35:16,532
Oh, no.

310
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:38,971
Whoo!

311
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,846
- Nice shooting.
- Now that was some flying.

312
00:35:54,945 --> 00:35:55,929
- Thanks.
- How did you do that?

313
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,306
- I don't know.
- No one trained you?

314
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:59,141
I've flown some ships, but
I've never left the planet.

315
00:35:59,242 --> 00:36:00,393
- Your last shot was dead-on.
- That was amazing.

316
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:01,811
- You got him with one blast!
- You set me up for it.

317
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:03,271
- It was perfect.
- That was pretty good.

318
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:08,918
You're okay. He's with the Resistance.

319
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,920
He's gonna get you home.

320
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:14,047
We both will.

321
00:36:19,887 --> 00:36:21,012
I don't know your name.

322
00:36:22,974 --> 00:36:24,516
Finn. What's yours?

323
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,103
I'm Rey.

324
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:32,983
Rey...

325
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,887
Help me with this. Quick!

326
00:36:35,987 --> 00:36:37,362
Whoa, what's going on?

327
00:36:48,623 --> 00:36:52,503
Sir... we were unable
to acquire the droid on Jakku.

328
00:36:54,963 --> 00:36:58,800
It escaped capture aboard a stolen
Corellian YT model freighter.

329
00:37:00,344 --> 00:37:02,413
The droid...

330
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:04,139
stole a freighter?

331
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:05,641
Not exactly, sir.

332
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:07,309
It had help.

333
00:37:10,938 --> 00:37:14,525
We have no confirmation but we believe
FN-2187 may have helped in the escape.

334
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:33,878
Anything else?

335
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:38,173
The two were accompanied by a girl.

336
00:37:43,596 --> 00:37:45,347
What girl?

337
00:37:48,059 --> 00:37:49,126
It's the motivator.

338
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:50,710
Grab me a Harris wrench, check in there.

339
00:37:50,811 --> 00:37:51,795
How bad is it?

340
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:53,563
If we wanna live, not good.

341
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,632
They're hunting for us now.

342
00:37:54,731 --> 00:37:55,900
We've gotta get out of this system!

343
00:37:56,025 --> 00:37:58,735
BB-8 said the location of the
Resistance base is "need to know".

344
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,471
If I'm taking you there, I need to know!

345
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,572
This?

346
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,449
You gotta tell us where your base is.

347
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:07,143
I don't speak that.

348
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:08,980
All right, between us...

349
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,539
I'm not with the Resistance, okay?

350
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:13,108
I'm just trying to get away
from the First Order.

351
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:14,943
But you tell us where the base is...

352
00:38:15,043 --> 00:38:16,461
I'll get you there first. Deal?

353
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:20,048
- Droid, please!
- Pilex driver, hurry.

354
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:22,802
- So, where's your base?
- Go on, BB-8, tell her.

355
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,014
Please.

356
00:38:29,057 --> 00:38:30,934
- The Ileenium system?
- Yeah, the Ileenium system.

357
00:38:31,059 --> 00:38:32,686
That's the one. Get us there
as fast as you can.

358
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:34,396
I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal.

359
00:38:34,563 --> 00:38:35,630
I need the bonding tape, hurry!

360
00:38:35,731 --> 00:38:36,798
What about you?

361
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,108
I gotta get back to Jakku.

362
00:38:38,233 --> 00:38:39,175
Back to Jak...

363
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,719
Why does everyone wanna go back to Jakku?

364
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,405
- It's not that one. No. No.
- That place is...

365
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,391
The one I'm pointing to. No.

366
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,784
No. No!

367
00:38:46,909 --> 00:38:48,244
If we don't patch it up...

368
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:51,188
the propulsion tank will overflow
and flood the ship with poisonous gas!

369
00:38:51,288 --> 00:38:52,289
- This?
- Yes.

370
00:38:53,666 --> 00:38:56,485
Hey, Rey, you're a pilot.

371
00:38:56,585 --> 00:38:58,487
You can fly anywhere. Why go back?

372
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,864
You got a family?

373
00:38:59,963 --> 00:39:01,090
You got a boyfriend? A cute boyfriend?

374
00:39:01,215 --> 00:39:02,657
None of your business, that's why.

375
00:39:05,094 --> 00:39:06,469
- That can't be good.
- No, it can't be.

376
00:39:12,434 --> 00:39:13,436
Someone's locked on to us.

377
00:39:13,561 --> 00:39:15,103
All controls are overridden.

378
00:39:21,902 --> 00:39:23,612
Get off! Get off!

379
00:39:25,364 --> 00:39:26,364
See anything?

380
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:28,826
Oh, no.

381
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,068
It's the First Order.

382
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:39,961
What do we do? There must be something.

383
00:39:40,755 --> 00:39:42,405
- You said poisonous gas.
- I fixed that.

384
00:39:42,505 --> 00:39:43,507
Can you unfix it?

385
00:39:49,304 --> 00:39:50,306
Come on, BB-8.

386
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:52,932
I got him.

387
00:39:54,268 --> 00:39:56,019
I'm okay.

388
00:39:56,853 --> 00:39:58,396
BB-8, get off me!

389
00:40:01,275 --> 00:40:02,927
Do you think this will work
on the stormtroopers?

390
00:40:03,027 --> 00:40:05,570
Yeah. Their masks filter out
smoke, not toxins.

391
00:40:12,952 --> 00:40:14,121
- Hurry.
- I'm hurrying.

392
00:40:26,217 --> 00:40:28,619
Chewie...

393
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:29,969
we're home.

394
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:47,137
Where are the others?

395
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:48,806
- Where's the pilot?
- I'm the pilot.

396
00:40:48,905 --> 00:40:50,349
You?

397
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:52,393
No, it's true.
We're the only ones on board.

398
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:53,911
You can understand that thing?

399
00:40:54,036 --> 00:40:56,271
And "that thing" can
understand you, too, so watch it.

400
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:58,289
Come on out of there.

401
00:40:58,998 --> 00:41:00,876
- Where'd you get this ship?
- Niima Outpost.

402
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:03,528
Jakku? That junkyard?

403
00:41:03,628 --> 00:41:04,822
Thank you! Junkyard.

404
00:41:04,922 --> 00:41:06,990
Told you we should have
double-checked the Western Reaches.

405
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,826
Who had it? Ducain?

406
00:41:08,925 --> 00:41:10,744
I stole it. From Unkar Plutt.

407
00:41:10,844 --> 00:41:13,054
He stole it from the Irving Boys,
who stole it from Ducain.

408
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:15,458
Who stole it from me!

409
00:41:15,557 --> 00:41:16,958
Well, you tell him that Han Solo...

410
00:41:17,059 --> 00:41:19,436
just stole back the
Millennium Falcon for good.

411
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:22,438
This is the Millennium Falcon?
You're Han Solo?

412
00:41:24,065 --> 00:41:25,608
I used to be.

413
00:41:26,277 --> 00:41:27,719
Han Solo, the Rebellion general?

414
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,179
No, the smuggler.

415
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,097
Wasn't he a war hero?

416
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:34,518
This is the ship that made
the Kessel Run in 14 parsecs?

417
00:41:34,617 --> 00:41:35,869
Twelve!

418
00:41:36,954 --> 00:41:38,414
Fourteen.

419
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:54,929
Hey!

420
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:58,416
Some moof-milker
put a compressor on the ignition line.

421
00:41:58,516 --> 00:41:59,585
Unkar Plutt did.

422
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:01,045
I thought it was a mistake, too.
Puts too much...

423
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:03,438
...stress on the hyperdrive.

424
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:05,940
Chewie, throw them in a pod.

425
00:42:06,065 --> 00:42:07,927
We'll drop them at the
nearest inhabited planet.

426
00:42:08,027 --> 00:42:09,719
Wait, no.

427
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,222
- We need your help.
- My help?

428
00:42:12,322 --> 00:42:15,242
This droid has to get to the
Resistance base as soon as possible.

429
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:18,329
He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker.

430
00:42:22,833 --> 00:42:25,753
You are the Han Solo that
fought with the Rebellion.

431
00:42:31,842 --> 00:42:32,842
You knew him.

432
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:39,291
Yeah. I knew him.

433
00:42:39,391 --> 00:42:41,018
I knew Luke.

434
00:42:43,811 --> 00:42:46,106
Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten loose.

435
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:47,775
Wait, what?

436
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:50,360
Did you just say Rathtars?

437
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,096
Hey!

438
00:42:52,195 --> 00:42:54,739
You're not hauling Rathtars
on this freighter, are you?

439
00:42:55,282 --> 00:42:57,476
I'm hauling Rathtars.

440
00:42:57,576 --> 00:43:00,771
Oh, great. It's the Guavian Death Gang.

441
00:43:00,871 --> 00:43:02,331
Must have tracked us from Nantoon.

442
00:43:02,456 --> 00:43:04,233
What's a Rathtar?

443
00:43:04,333 --> 00:43:05,818
They're big and they're dangerous.

444
00:43:05,918 --> 00:43:07,443
You ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?

445
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:08,570
- No.
- Good.

446
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,530
I got three of them going to King Prana.

447
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,949
Three? How'd you get them on board?

448
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:14,760
I used to have a bigger crew.

449
00:43:18,347 --> 00:43:20,248
Get below and stay there until I say so...

450
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:21,916
and don't even think about
taking the Falcon.

451
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,001
What about BB-8?

452
00:43:23,101 --> 00:43:24,795
He stays with me
until I get rid of the gang...

453
00:43:24,894 --> 00:43:26,422
then you can have him back
and be on your way.

454
00:43:26,521 --> 00:43:28,465
What about the Rathtars?
Where are you keeping them?

455
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,927
- There's one.
- What are you gonna do?

456
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:35,306
Same thing I always do.
Talk my way out of it.

457
00:43:36,657 --> 00:43:38,909
Yes, I do. Every time.

458
00:43:56,175 --> 00:43:58,161
Han Solo.

459
00:43:58,262 --> 00:43:59,722
You're a dead man.

460
00:43:59,847 --> 00:44:02,557
Bala-Tik. What's the problem?

461
00:44:02,766 --> 00:44:05,436
The problem is we loaned you
50,000 for this job.

462
00:44:05,601 --> 00:44:08,063
- Can you see them?
- No.

463
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:11,233
I heard you also borrowed
50,000 from Kanjiklub.

464
00:44:11,442 --> 00:44:13,568
You know you can't trust
those little freaks.

465
00:44:14,235 --> 00:44:16,639
How long we known each other?

466
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:17,806
They have blasters.

467
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:18,974
A lot of them.

468
00:44:19,074 --> 00:44:22,268
Not long. We want our money back now.

469
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:24,355
You think hunting Rathtars is cheap?

470
00:44:24,454 --> 00:44:25,606
I spent that money.

471
00:44:25,706 --> 00:44:28,125
Kanjiklub wants
their investment back, too.

472
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,527
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!

473
00:44:30,626 --> 00:44:32,487
Tell that to Kanjiklub.

474
00:44:41,804 --> 00:44:43,998
Tasu Leech.

475
00:44:44,099 --> 00:44:45,099
Good to see you.

476
00:44:53,942 --> 00:44:56,929
Boys, you're both gonna
get what I promised.

477
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:58,389
Have I ever not delivered...

478
00:44:58,489 --> 00:44:59,989
- for you before?
- Yeah.

479
00:45:04,286 --> 00:45:07,289
- What was the second time?
- Your game is old.

480
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:09,916
There's no one in the galaxy
left for you to swindle.

481
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:13,570
That BB unit.

482
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:16,507
The First Order is looking
for one just like it.

483
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:21,302
And two fugitives.

484
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:26,307
First I've heard of it.

485
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:33,315
Wait, wait, wait.

486
00:45:36,485 --> 00:45:39,762
If we close the blast doors in that
corridor we can trap both gangs!

487
00:45:39,862 --> 00:45:41,306
We'll close the blast doors from here?

488
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,199
Resetting the fuses should do it.

489
00:45:51,166 --> 00:45:52,943
I got a bad feeling about this.

490
00:45:53,043 --> 00:45:55,170
- Oh, no.
- "Oh, no," what?

491
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,114
Wrong fuses.

492
00:45:57,213 --> 00:45:58,382
Kill them!

493
00:45:58,507 --> 00:45:59,715
- Whoa...
- And take the droid!

494
00:46:25,534 --> 00:46:27,369
- This was a mistake!
- Huge!

495
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:41,592
What do they look like?

496
00:46:47,556 --> 00:46:49,557
They look like that.

497
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,644
- This way.
- Are you sure?

498
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:56,731
No, no, no!

499
00:46:57,773 --> 00:46:59,150
Finn!

500
00:47:00,152 --> 00:47:01,235
Finn!

501
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:03,405
Rey!

502
00:47:06,574 --> 00:47:07,867
Get off! Get off!

503
00:47:13,289 --> 00:47:15,626
- Rey!
- Finn!

504
00:47:16,835 --> 00:47:17,920
Finn!

505
00:47:18,586 --> 00:47:20,255
Get off me!

506
00:47:31,934 --> 00:47:33,434
Rey!

507
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:39,358
Get off! Get off!

508
00:47:41,777 --> 00:47:43,277
Finn!

509
00:47:43,945 --> 00:47:46,280
- It had me! But the door...
- That was lucky.

510
00:47:50,327 --> 00:47:52,621
I got the door. Cover us!

511
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,338
Chewie!

512
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:05,800
You okay?

513
00:48:06,969 --> 00:48:07,969
Wow.

514
00:48:10,179 --> 00:48:12,391
Come on! Come on!

515
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,128
Han.

516
00:48:17,228 --> 00:48:19,481
You, close the door behind us.
You, take care of Chewie!

517
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:28,389
Hey, where are you going?

518
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:30,141
Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump, too.

519
00:48:30,242 --> 00:48:32,034
If we don't prime that,
we're not going anywhere.

520
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:33,327
I hate that guy.

521
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,938
- And you could use a co-pilot.
- I got one, he's back there.

522
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,376
Watch the thrust. We're going
out of here at lightspeed.

523
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:42,278
From inside the hangar?
Is that even possible?

524
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:44,614
I never ask that question
till after I've done it.

525
00:48:46,882 --> 00:48:49,010
This is not how I thought
this day was gonna go.

526
00:48:49,135 --> 00:48:51,079
Angle the shield. Hang on back there.

527
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:52,347
No problem!

528
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:03,525
Come on, baby, don't let me down.

529
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:08,030
- What?
- Compressor.

530
00:49:16,538 --> 00:49:19,650
Inform the First Order
that Han Solo has the droid they want.

531
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:21,751
And it's aboard the Millennium Falcon.

532
00:49:30,677 --> 00:49:35,056
The droid will soon be
delivered to the Resistance...

533
00:49:36,266 --> 00:49:40,061
leading them to the last Jedi.

534
00:49:41,271 --> 00:49:45,025
If Skywalker returns...

535
00:49:45,567 --> 00:49:49,570
the new Jedi will rise.

536
00:49:50,739 --> 00:49:52,282
Supreme Leader,
I take full responsibility...

537
00:49:52,407 --> 00:49:54,076
General!

538
00:49:56,286 --> 00:49:59,081
Our strategy must now change.

539
00:49:59,206 --> 00:50:01,248
The weapon. It is ready.

540
00:50:01,375 --> 00:50:03,626
I believe the time has come to use it.

541
00:50:03,751 --> 00:50:06,530
We shall destroy the government
that supports the Resistance...

542
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:08,322
the Republic.

543
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:11,635
Without their friends to protect them
the Resistance will be vulnerable.

544
00:50:11,885 --> 00:50:14,788
And we will stop them
before they reach Skywalker.

545
00:50:14,887 --> 00:50:16,139
Go.

546
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:18,333
Oversee preparations.

547
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:20,101
Yes, Supreme Leader.

548
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:27,442
There has been an awakening.

549
00:50:29,152 --> 00:50:30,903
Have you felt it?

550
00:50:32,447 --> 00:50:33,489
Yes.

551
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:36,492
There's something more.

552
00:50:38,036 --> 00:50:42,206
The droid we seek is aboard
the Millennium Falcon.

553
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:45,860
In the hands of your father...

554
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,797
Han Solo.

555
00:50:52,425 --> 00:50:54,802
He means nothing to me.

556
00:50:54,927 --> 00:50:59,724
Even you, master of the Knights of Ren...

557
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:03,811
have never faced such a test.

558
00:51:04,438 --> 00:51:07,648
By the grace of your training,
I will not be seduced.

559
00:51:08,775 --> 00:51:10,610
We shall see.

560
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,030
We shall see.

561
00:51:23,123 --> 00:51:25,333
- Electrical overload.
- I can fix that.

562
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:26,710
Coolant's leaking.

563
00:51:28,043 --> 00:51:30,780
- Try transferring auxiliary power...
- ...to the secondary tank.

564
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,423
I got it.

565
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,217
Chewie, come on!

566
00:51:35,844 --> 00:51:37,411
I need help with this giant hairy thing!

567
00:51:37,512 --> 00:51:38,512
Stop moving!

568
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:42,349
Chewie!

569
00:51:42,476 --> 00:51:44,186
You hurt Chewie,
you're gonna deal with me!

570
00:51:44,311 --> 00:51:46,646
Hurt him? He almost killed me six times!

571
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:49,023
Which is fine!

572
00:51:49,148 --> 00:51:52,652
This hyperdrive blows, there are gonna be
pieces of us in three different systems.

573
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,032
What'd you do?

574
00:51:58,074 --> 00:51:59,992
I bypassed the compressor.

575
00:52:02,329 --> 00:52:03,329
Huh.

576
00:52:06,583 --> 00:52:07,876
Move, ball.

577
00:52:10,045 --> 00:52:12,114
Ah, don't say that.

578
00:52:12,213 --> 00:52:13,882
You did great. Just rest.

579
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:15,884
Good job, kid.

580
00:52:16,342 --> 00:52:17,344
Thanks.

581
00:52:17,885 --> 00:52:19,161
You're welcome.

582
00:52:23,934 --> 00:52:26,811
So... fugitives, huh?

583
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:30,005
The First Order wants the map.

584
00:52:30,106 --> 00:52:31,398
Finn is with the Resistance.

585
00:52:32,025 --> 00:52:33,443
I'm just a scavenger.

586
00:52:35,487 --> 00:52:36,487
Let's see what you got.

587
00:52:37,364 --> 00:52:39,449
Go ahead.

588
00:52:48,583 --> 00:52:50,735
This map's not complete.

589
00:52:50,835 --> 00:52:52,336
It's just a piece.

590
00:52:53,547 --> 00:52:57,451
Ever since Luke disappeared
people have been looking for him.

591
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,052
Why did he leave?

592
00:53:00,262 --> 00:53:02,998
He was training a new generation of Jedi.

593
00:53:03,097 --> 00:53:07,143
One boy, an apprentice,
turned against him, destroyed it all.

594
00:53:08,728 --> 00:53:10,630
Luke felt responsible.

595
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:13,233
He just walked away from everything.

596
00:53:13,942 --> 00:53:15,402
Do you know what happened to him?

597
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:17,945
A lot of rumors. Stories.

598
00:53:19,947 --> 00:53:22,157
People that knew him best...

599
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:26,036
think he went looking
for the first Jedi temple.

600
00:53:27,789 --> 00:53:29,106
The Jedi were real?

601
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:31,400
I used to wonder about that myself.

602
00:53:31,501 --> 00:53:33,711
Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo.

603
00:53:34,588 --> 00:53:37,157
A magical power holding
together good and evil...

604
00:53:37,257 --> 00:53:39,384
the dark side and the light.

605
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,929
Crazy thing is...

606
00:53:45,724 --> 00:53:46,766
it's true.

607
00:53:49,311 --> 00:53:50,936
The Force. The Jedi.

608
00:53:53,523 --> 00:53:54,523
All of it.

609
00:53:57,777 --> 00:53:59,094
It's all true.

610
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:04,492
No, you rest.

611
00:54:04,617 --> 00:54:07,353
You want my help? You're getting it.

612
00:54:07,454 --> 00:54:09,496
Gonna see an old friend.
She'll get your droid home.

613
00:54:10,789 --> 00:54:12,125
This is our stop.

614
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:32,394
I didn't know there was this much green
in the whole galaxy.

615
00:55:00,382 --> 00:55:02,425
Hey, Solo, I'm not sure what
we're walking into here...

616
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:04,159
Did you just call me Solo?

617
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,869
Sorry. Han. Mr. Solo.

618
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,038
You should know...

619
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:09,498
I'm a big deal in the Resistance.

620
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:11,934
Which puts a real target on my back.

621
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,628
Are there any conspirators here?

622
00:55:13,728 --> 00:55:15,605
Like, First Order sympathizers?

623
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:18,382
Listen, Big Deal.

624
00:55:18,483 --> 00:55:20,385
You got another problem.

625
00:55:20,485 --> 00:55:22,653
Women always figure out the truth.

626
00:55:24,239 --> 00:55:25,572
Always.

627
00:55:31,579 --> 00:55:32,956
You might need this.

628
00:55:34,248 --> 00:55:35,916
I think I can handle myself.

629
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:38,152
I know you do. That's why
I'm giving it to you.

630
00:55:38,253 --> 00:55:39,253
Take it.

631
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:43,240
You know how to use one of those?

632
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:44,992
Yeah. You pull the trigger.

633
00:55:45,092 --> 00:55:46,927
Little bit more to it than that.

634
00:55:47,429 --> 00:55:49,097
You got a lot to learn.

635
00:55:50,514 --> 00:55:51,766
You got a name?

636
00:55:52,684 --> 00:55:53,684
Rey.

637
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:55,394
Rey.

638
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:01,675
I been thinking about bringing
on some more crew, Rey.

639
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,719
A second mate. Someone to help out.

640
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:07,114
Someone who can keep up with Chewie
and me appreciates the Falcon.

641
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:09,016
Are you offering me a job?

642
00:56:09,117 --> 00:56:11,619
I wouldn't be nice to you.
Doesn't pay much.

643
00:56:11,744 --> 00:56:13,579
You're offering me a job.

644
00:56:14,789 --> 00:56:16,291
I'm thinking about it.

645
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,128
Well?

646
00:56:25,632 --> 00:56:28,302
If you were, I'd be flattered.
But I have to get home.

647
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,722
Where, Jakku?

648
00:56:31,306 --> 00:56:33,099
I've already been away too long.

649
00:56:34,809 --> 00:56:37,186
Chewie, check out the ship
as best you can.

650
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:43,818
That's too bad. Chewie kind of likes you.

651
00:56:46,905 --> 00:56:50,199
- Solo, why are we here again?
- To get your droid on a clean ship.

652
00:56:50,324 --> 00:56:51,266
Clean?

653
00:56:51,367 --> 00:56:54,244
You think it was luck
that Chewie and I found the Falcon?

654
00:56:54,913 --> 00:56:58,875
If we can find it on our scanners
the First Order's not far behind.

655
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,777
Wanna get BB-8 to the Resistance?

656
00:57:01,878 --> 00:57:03,713
Maz Kanata's our best bet.

657
00:57:04,588 --> 00:57:06,074
We can trust her, right?

658
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:07,717
Relax, kid.

659
00:57:07,842 --> 00:57:10,512
She's run this watering hole
for a thousand years.

660
00:57:11,262 --> 00:57:14,748
Maz is a bit of an acquired taste,
so let me do the talking.

661
00:57:14,849 --> 00:57:16,583
And whatever you do, don't stare.

662
00:57:16,684 --> 00:57:17,726
At what?

663
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:19,853
Any of it.

664
00:57:41,041 --> 00:57:43,043
Han Solo!

665
00:57:47,215 --> 00:57:48,465
Oh, boy.

666
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:49,759
Hey, Maz.

667
00:57:53,596 --> 00:57:55,556
Where's my boyfriend?

668
00:57:56,056 --> 00:57:57,666
Chewie's working on the Falcon.

669
00:57:57,766 --> 00:57:58,768
I like that Wookiee.

670
00:57:59,561 --> 00:58:01,503
I assume you need something.

671
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,005
Desperately.

672
00:58:03,106 --> 00:58:04,106
Let's get to it.

673
00:58:58,661 --> 00:59:00,121
Forgive me.

674
00:59:02,789 --> 00:59:04,458
I feel it again.

675
00:59:08,128 --> 00:59:09,672
The pull to the light.

676
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:15,010
Supreme Leader senses it.

677
00:59:16,094 --> 00:59:17,472
Show me again.

678
00:59:17,972 --> 00:59:20,141
The power of the darkness.

679
00:59:21,434 --> 00:59:24,019
And I will let nothing stand in our way.

680
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:26,356
Show me...

681
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:29,858
Grandfather...

682
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,655
and I will finish...

683
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:36,157
what you started.

684
00:59:48,961 --> 00:59:50,380
A map.

685
00:59:51,005 --> 00:59:53,115
To Skywalker himself?

686
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,952
You are right back in the mess.

687
00:59:56,052 --> 00:59:59,514
Maz, I need you to get this droid to Leia.

688
01:00:00,347 --> 01:00:01,349
Hmm...

689
01:00:01,474 --> 01:00:02,474
No.

690
01:00:03,851 --> 01:00:07,855
You've been running away
from this fight for too long.

691
01:00:08,356 --> 01:00:09,298
Han.

692
01:00:12,025 --> 01:00:13,527
Go home.

693
01:00:14,195 --> 01:00:15,471
Leia doesn't wanna see me.

694
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,782
Please, we came here for your help.

695
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:20,034
What fight?

696
01:00:21,244 --> 01:00:23,271
The only fight.

697
01:00:23,371 --> 01:00:25,523
Against the dark side.

698
01:00:25,623 --> 01:00:29,168
Through the ages
I've seen evil take many forms.

699
01:00:30,253 --> 01:00:32,447
The Sith. The Empire.

700
01:00:32,547 --> 01:00:35,882
Today, it is the First Order.

701
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:39,594
Their shadow is spreading
across the galaxy.

702
01:00:39,721 --> 01:00:41,097
We must face them.

703
01:00:41,222 --> 01:00:43,266
Fight them.

704
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,934
All of us.

705
01:00:45,559 --> 01:00:47,128
There is no fight against the First Order.

706
01:00:47,228 --> 01:00:48,353
Not one we can win.

707
01:00:49,563 --> 01:00:50,797
Look around.

708
01:00:50,898 --> 01:00:53,275
There's no chance we haven't
been recognized already.

709
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,610
I bet you the First Order
is on their way right...

710
01:00:56,903 --> 01:00:57,905
What's this?

711
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:00,742
What are you doing?

712
01:01:05,454 --> 01:01:06,956
Solo, what is she doing?

713
01:01:07,081 --> 01:01:08,833
I don't know. But it ain't good.

714
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,777
If you live long enough...

715
01:01:10,876 --> 01:01:14,380
you see the same eyes in different people.

716
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:19,760
I'm looking at the eyes
of a man who wants to run.

717
01:01:22,637 --> 01:01:24,599
You don't know a thing about me.

718
01:01:25,932 --> 01:01:28,936
Where I'm from. What I've seen.

719
01:01:29,603 --> 01:01:32,273
You don't know the First Order like I do.

720
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:35,385
They'll slaughter us.

721
01:01:35,485 --> 01:01:37,612
We all need to run.

722
01:01:38,737 --> 01:01:39,780
Hmm.

723
01:01:46,079 --> 01:01:47,079
You see those two?

724
01:01:47,789 --> 01:01:50,942
They'll trade work for transportation
to the Outer Rim.

725
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:53,251
There, you can disappear.

726
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:54,461
Finn?

727
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:57,882
Come with me.

728
01:01:58,925 --> 01:02:00,952
What about BB-8? We're not done yet.

729
01:02:01,052 --> 01:02:02,719
We have to get him back to your base.

730
01:02:07,809 --> 01:02:09,143
I can't.

731
01:02:17,943 --> 01:02:19,152
Keep it, kid.

732
01:02:29,413 --> 01:02:30,831
Who's the girl?

733
01:02:35,795 --> 01:02:37,739
I was told you can get me
to the Outer Rim.

734
01:02:37,838 --> 01:02:38,922
What are you doing?

735
01:02:40,675 --> 01:02:41,675
Don't leave without me.

736
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:47,331
You can't just go. I won't let you.

737
01:02:47,431 --> 01:02:48,498
I'm not who you think I am.

738
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:49,666
Finn, what are you talking about?

739
01:02:49,766 --> 01:02:50,809
I'm not Resistance.

740
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:53,019
I'm not a hero.

741
01:02:56,273 --> 01:02:58,025
I'm a stormtrooper.

742
01:02:59,193 --> 01:03:02,112
Like all of them, I was taken
from a family I'll never know.

743
01:03:02,864 --> 01:03:04,865
And raised to do one thing.

744
01:03:05,574 --> 01:03:08,702
But my first battle, I made a choice.

745
01:03:09,871 --> 01:03:11,706
I wasn't gonna kill for them.

746
01:03:12,373 --> 01:03:15,293
So I ran. Right into you.

747
01:03:16,878 --> 01:03:18,963
And you looked at me like no one ever had.

748
01:03:21,882 --> 01:03:24,177
I was ashamed of what I was.

749
01:03:26,721 --> 01:03:28,722
But I'm done with the First Order.

750
01:03:28,847 --> 01:03:30,641
I'm never going back.

751
01:03:32,726 --> 01:03:34,478
Rey, come with me.

752
01:03:35,563 --> 01:03:36,813
Don't go.

753
01:03:41,985 --> 01:03:43,737
Take care of yourself.

754
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,199
Please.

755
01:04:00,922 --> 01:04:02,989
No!

756
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:05,259
No!

757
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:21,442
No! Come back!

758
01:04:22,443 --> 01:04:24,237
No!

759
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:42,128
Come back!

760
01:04:52,472 --> 01:04:54,307
No!

761
01:05:45,275 --> 01:05:47,094
No!

762
01:05:47,193 --> 01:05:48,737
Its energy...

763
01:05:52,532 --> 01:05:54,577
- ...surrounds us...
- No!

764
01:05:54,702 --> 01:05:57,038
...and binds us...

765
01:06:04,878 --> 01:06:05,987
The Force will be...

766
01:06:15,056 --> 01:06:16,556
No!

767
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:18,559
Come back!

768
01:06:18,684 --> 01:06:20,186
Quiet, girl.

769
01:06:21,061 --> 01:06:22,063
No!

770
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:27,650
Rey?

771
01:06:32,239 --> 01:06:34,949
These are your first steps.

772
01:06:39,914 --> 01:06:40,914
What was that?

773
01:06:43,166 --> 01:06:44,876
I shouldn't have gone in there.

774
01:06:47,128 --> 01:06:49,572
That lightsaber was Luke's.

775
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:51,467
And his father's before him.

776
01:06:51,592 --> 01:06:55,221
And now, it calls to you.

777
01:06:55,346 --> 01:06:56,764
I have to get back to Jakku.

778
01:06:57,431 --> 01:06:59,099
Han told me.

779
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:08,884
Dear child.

780
01:07:08,983 --> 01:07:11,012
I see your eyes.

781
01:07:11,112 --> 01:07:14,097
You already know the truth.

782
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:16,659
Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku...

783
01:07:17,952 --> 01:07:19,954
they're never coming back.

784
01:07:26,001 --> 01:07:29,630
But... there's someone who still could.

785
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:33,909
Luke.

786
01:07:34,009 --> 01:07:37,679
The belonging you seek
is not behind you...

787
01:07:37,804 --> 01:07:39,472
it is ahead.

788
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:43,143
I am no Jedi, but I know the Force.

789
01:07:43,268 --> 01:07:47,356
It moves through and surrounds
every living thing.

790
01:07:49,275 --> 01:07:50,860
Close your eyes.

791
01:07:53,153 --> 01:07:54,155
Feel it.

792
01:07:55,447 --> 01:07:57,532
The light...

793
01:07:57,657 --> 01:08:00,034
it's always been there.

794
01:08:00,161 --> 01:08:02,163
It will guide you.

795
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:06,333
The saber. Take it.

796
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:12,280
I'm never touching that thing again.

797
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:13,882
I don't want any part of this.

798
01:08:17,344 --> 01:08:18,345
Hmm.

799
01:08:40,367 --> 01:08:43,871
Today is the end of the Republic.

800
01:08:45,872 --> 01:08:51,377
The end of a regime
that acquiesces to disorder.

801
01:08:52,671 --> 01:08:56,759
At this very moment,
in a system far from here...

802
01:08:56,884 --> 01:09:01,721
the New Republic lies to the galaxy...

803
01:09:01,846 --> 01:09:05,434
while secretly supporting the treachery...

804
01:09:06,226 --> 01:09:09,546
of the loathsome Resistance.

805
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:13,134
This fierce machine
which you have built...

806
01:09:13,234 --> 01:09:15,069
upon which we stand...

807
01:09:15,194 --> 01:09:17,555
will bring an end to the Senate!

808
01:09:17,654 --> 01:09:20,474
To their cherished fleet!

809
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:25,020
All remaining systems
will bow to the First Order!

810
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,622
And will remember this...

811
01:09:27,747 --> 01:09:32,795
as the last day of the Republic!

812
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:36,698
Confirm transfer to manual control.

813
01:09:36,798 --> 01:09:38,341
Configure!

814
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:39,926
Fire!

815
01:10:39,987 --> 01:10:42,655
No. What is it?

816
01:10:58,671 --> 01:10:59,840
It was the Republic.

817
01:11:01,007 --> 01:11:02,635
The First Order, they've done it.

818
01:11:05,011 --> 01:11:06,180
Where's Rey?

819
01:11:23,447 --> 01:11:25,698
What are you doing?

820
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:28,894
You have to go back.

821
01:11:28,993 --> 01:11:30,119
I'm leaving.

822
01:11:30,871 --> 01:11:32,355
BB-8...

823
01:11:32,456 --> 01:11:33,524
No, you can't.

824
01:11:33,623 --> 01:11:35,775
You have to go back, you're too important.

825
01:11:35,876 --> 01:11:37,043
They'll help you.

826
01:11:51,725 --> 01:11:53,018
I've had this for ages.

827
01:11:57,064 --> 01:11:58,399
Kept it locked away.

828
01:11:58,856 --> 01:11:59,858
Where'd you get that?

829
01:12:01,150 --> 01:12:04,238
A good question. For another time.

830
01:12:05,238 --> 01:12:06,306
Take it.

831
01:12:06,407 --> 01:12:07,908
Find your friend!

832
01:12:15,082 --> 01:12:17,083
Those beasts.

833
01:12:17,208 --> 01:12:18,210
They're here.

834
01:12:42,109 --> 01:12:44,778
FN-417, hold position.

835
01:12:46,613 --> 01:12:48,282
Oh, safety.

836
01:13:13,974 --> 01:13:15,042
Sir.

837
01:13:15,141 --> 01:13:16,460
The droid was spotted heading west.

838
01:13:16,560 --> 01:13:17,560
With a girl.

839
01:13:23,108 --> 01:13:25,551
You have to keep going. Stay out of sight.

840
01:13:25,652 --> 01:13:28,471
I'll try to fight them off.

841
01:13:28,572 --> 01:13:29,823
I hope so, too.

842
01:13:42,252 --> 01:13:44,171
Come on, Chewie!

843
01:13:46,590 --> 01:13:48,574
Rey and BB-8! They need you!

844
01:13:48,675 --> 01:13:49,659
Now! Go!

845
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:52,078
I need a weapon!

846
01:13:52,179 --> 01:13:53,639
You have one!

847
01:14:03,023 --> 01:14:05,692
Hey, can I try that?

848
01:14:12,198 --> 01:14:13,658
I like this thing.

849
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:20,916
Traitor!

850
01:15:05,668 --> 01:15:07,488
- You okay, Big Deal?
- Thanks.

851
01:15:07,587 --> 01:15:08,588
Don't move.

852
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:11,591
TK-338, we have targets in custody.

853
01:15:17,764 --> 01:15:20,000
We have incoming at 28. 6.

854
01:15:20,100 --> 01:15:22,101
Move! Move! Move!

855
01:15:23,103 --> 01:15:26,088
Scramble all squads, repeat,
scramble all squads!

856
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:27,940
Head to higher cover and wait
for our position!

857
01:15:30,777 --> 01:15:32,279
It's the Resistance.

858
01:15:40,119 --> 01:15:42,355
Go straight at them!
Don't let these dogs scare you!

859
01:15:42,456 --> 01:15:44,082
- Copy that.
- We're with you, Poe.

860
01:16:12,819 --> 01:16:13,819
Quick!

861
01:16:41,806 --> 01:16:44,100
Whoo! Yeah!

862
01:16:44,768 --> 01:16:46,603
That's one hell of a pilot!

863
01:16:46,770 --> 01:16:48,020
Whoo-hoo!

864
01:17:42,367 --> 01:17:44,411
The girl I've heard so much about.

865
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:58,257
The droid.

866
01:17:59,926 --> 01:18:02,220
Where is it?

867
01:18:07,434 --> 01:18:09,060
Request air support.

868
01:18:16,193 --> 01:18:17,569
The map.

869
01:18:19,529 --> 01:18:21,681
You've seen it.

870
01:18:21,782 --> 01:18:24,117
Sir, Resistance fighters.

871
01:18:25,077 --> 01:18:26,661
We need more troops.

872
01:18:26,787 --> 01:18:28,622
Pull the division out.

873
01:18:28,747 --> 01:18:31,792
Forget the droid. We have what we need.

874
01:18:38,631 --> 01:18:39,925
Pull back to tree line!

875
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:56,841
No!

876
01:19:00,569 --> 01:19:01,988
No, no!

877
01:19:03,907 --> 01:19:05,992
No! No!

878
01:19:07,661 --> 01:19:08,994
Rey!

879
01:19:28,014 --> 01:19:30,015
He took her. Did you see that?

880
01:19:30,850 --> 01:19:32,252
He took her. She's gone.

881
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,520
Yeah, I know.

882
01:19:42,863 --> 01:19:44,197
Let's go.

883
01:19:57,877 --> 01:20:00,380
Goodness! Han Solo!

884
01:20:00,505 --> 01:20:02,673
It is I, C-3PO.

885
01:20:03,216 --> 01:20:06,344
You probably don't recognize me
because of the red arm.

886
01:20:06,469 --> 01:20:08,371
Look who it is, did you see who...

887
01:20:10,181 --> 01:20:11,182
Uh...

888
01:20:11,725 --> 01:20:12,725
Hmm.

889
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:15,878
Excuse me, Prin... General. Sorry.

890
01:20:15,979 --> 01:20:18,297
Come along, BB-8, quickly.

891
01:20:18,398 --> 01:20:21,067
Yes, I must get my proper arm reinstalled.

892
01:20:22,985 --> 01:20:24,738
You changed your hair.

893
01:20:27,073 --> 01:20:28,490
Same jacket.

894
01:20:29,743 --> 01:20:31,536
No, new jacket.

895
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:45,507
I saw him.

896
01:20:47,426 --> 01:20:49,595
Leia, I saw our son.

897
01:20:51,264 --> 01:20:52,556
He was here.

898
01:21:33,347 --> 01:21:34,349
Hey!

899
01:21:38,936 --> 01:21:40,814
BB-8, my buddy.

900
01:21:40,939 --> 01:21:42,882
Oh, it's so good to see you.

901
01:21:42,983 --> 01:21:43,966
Finn saved you?

902
01:21:44,067 --> 01:21:45,150
Where is he?

903
01:21:45,277 --> 01:21:46,485
Poe?

904
01:21:48,029 --> 01:21:49,029
Oh, no.

905
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:51,056
Poe Dameron, you're alive?

906
01:21:51,157 --> 01:21:53,310
- Buddy! So are you!
- What happened to you?

907
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:54,728
I got thrown from the crash.

908
01:21:54,828 --> 01:21:56,729
I woke up at night.
No you. No ship. Nothing.

909
01:21:56,829 --> 01:21:58,206
BB-8 says that you saved him.

910
01:21:58,331 --> 01:21:59,832
No, no, no. It wasn't just me.

911
01:21:59,957 --> 01:22:01,443
You completed my mission, Finn...

912
01:22:01,542 --> 01:22:02,543
That's my jacket.

913
01:22:02,711 --> 01:22:05,070
- Oh...
- No, no, no.

914
01:22:05,171 --> 01:22:06,922
Keep it. It suits you.

915
01:22:07,798 --> 01:22:09,551
You're a good man, Finn.

916
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:12,429
Poe, I need your help.

917
01:22:13,971 --> 01:22:16,807
PZ-4CO, report to communications.

918
01:22:19,894 --> 01:22:20,895
General Organa...

919
01:22:22,730 --> 01:22:24,858
I'm sorry to interrupt. This is Finn.

920
01:22:24,983 --> 01:22:27,801
- He needs to talk to you.
- And I need to talk to him.

921
01:22:27,902 --> 01:22:29,679
That was incredibly brave what you did.

922
01:22:29,779 --> 01:22:32,364
Renouncing the First Order,
saving this man's life.

923
01:22:32,489 --> 01:22:34,367
Thank you, ma'am. But a friend
of mine was taken prisoner.

924
01:22:34,492 --> 01:22:36,353
Han told me about the girl.

925
01:22:36,453 --> 01:22:37,578
I'm sorry.

926
01:22:37,703 --> 01:22:39,730
Finn's familiar with the weapon
that destroyed the Hosnian system.

927
01:22:39,831 --> 01:22:40,832
He worked on the base.

928
01:22:41,332 --> 01:22:43,251
We're desperate for anything
you can tell us.

929
01:22:43,376 --> 01:22:44,610
That's where my friend was taken.

930
01:22:44,711 --> 01:22:46,003
I've got to get there fast.

931
01:22:46,128 --> 01:22:49,882
And I will do everything I can to help but
first you need to tell us all you know.

932
01:22:52,886 --> 01:22:54,595
That sounds very scary.

933
01:22:56,722 --> 01:22:58,850
You must be so brave.

934
01:23:01,685 --> 01:23:02,686
General...

935
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:05,881
I regret to inform you,
but this map recovered from BB-8...

936
01:23:05,981 --> 01:23:07,466
is only partially complete.

937
01:23:07,567 --> 01:23:11,304
And even worse, it matches
no charted system on record.

938
01:23:11,404 --> 01:23:15,115
We simply do not have enough
information to locate Master Luke.

939
01:23:16,201 --> 01:23:19,287
Can't believe I was so foolish to think
I could find Luke and bring him home.

940
01:23:19,412 --> 01:23:20,521
Leia.

941
01:23:20,622 --> 01:23:21,689
Don't do that.

942
01:23:21,789 --> 01:23:22,983
Do what?

943
01:23:23,082 --> 01:23:24,208
Anything.

944
01:23:25,627 --> 01:23:27,503
Princesses.

945
01:23:27,628 --> 01:23:29,154
I'm trying to be helpful.

946
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:31,408
When did that ever help?

947
01:23:31,507 --> 01:23:33,217
And don't say the Death Star.

948
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:49,442
BB-8.

949
01:23:49,567 --> 01:23:52,595
You're wasting your time.

950
01:23:52,694 --> 01:23:55,782
It is very doubtful that R2 would have
the rest of the map in his backup data.

951
01:23:55,948 --> 01:23:58,059
I am afraid not.

952
01:23:58,158 --> 01:24:02,204
R2-D2 has been in low-power mode
ever since Master Luke went away.

953
01:24:04,791 --> 01:24:08,043
Sadly, he may never be his old self again.

954
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:11,381
Listen to me, will you?

955
01:24:12,381 --> 01:24:14,716
I know every time you...

956
01:24:16,927 --> 01:24:19,288
Every time you look at me
you're reminded of him.

957
01:24:19,389 --> 01:24:21,373
You think I want to forget him?

958
01:24:21,474 --> 01:24:23,143
I want him back.

959
01:24:23,268 --> 01:24:25,353
There's nothing more we could have done.

960
01:24:27,104 --> 01:24:28,465
There's too much Vader in him.

961
01:24:28,564 --> 01:24:31,467
That's why I wanted him
to train with Luke.

962
01:24:31,568 --> 01:24:33,261
I just never should have sent him away.

963
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,945
That's when I lost him.

964
01:24:36,197 --> 01:24:38,198
That's when I lost you both.

965
01:24:40,284 --> 01:24:42,953
We both had to deal with it
in our own way.

966
01:24:43,954 --> 01:24:46,916
I went back to the only thing
I was ever any good at.

967
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:48,710
We both did.

968
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,654
We lost our son.

969
01:24:52,755 --> 01:24:53,907
Forever.

970
01:24:54,006 --> 01:24:55,007
No.

971
01:24:55,132 --> 01:24:56,676
It was Snoke.

972
01:24:57,135 --> 01:24:59,746
He seduced our son to the dark side.

973
01:24:59,845 --> 01:25:01,430
But we can still save him.

974
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:03,265
Me.

975
01:25:04,184 --> 01:25:05,225
You.

976
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:08,380
If Luke couldn't reach him, how could I?

977
01:25:08,479 --> 01:25:09,898
Luke is a Jedi.

978
01:25:11,483 --> 01:25:12,817
You're his father.

979
01:25:15,528 --> 01:25:19,306
There is still light in him, I know it.

980
01:25:19,407 --> 01:25:21,100
General...

981
01:25:21,201 --> 01:25:23,703
the reconnaissance report
on the enemy base is coming.

982
01:25:50,521 --> 01:25:51,523
Where am I?

983
01:25:53,858 --> 01:25:55,176
You're my guest.

984
01:25:55,275 --> 01:25:56,594
Where are the others?

985
01:25:56,694 --> 01:25:58,345
Do you mean the murderers...

986
01:25:58,445 --> 01:26:01,323
traitors, and thieves you call friends?

987
01:26:02,283 --> 01:26:04,743
You'll be relieved to hear I have no idea.

988
01:26:06,746 --> 01:26:08,831
You still want to kill me.

989
01:26:09,623 --> 01:26:13,293
That happens when you're being hunted
by a creature in a mask.

990
01:26:38,235 --> 01:26:40,070
Tell me about the droid.

991
01:26:40,904 --> 01:26:44,141
He's a BB unit with a selenium drive
and a thermal hyperscan vindicator.

992
01:26:44,242 --> 01:26:46,351
It's carrying a section
of a navigational chart.

993
01:26:46,452 --> 01:26:47,811
And we have the rest.

994
01:26:47,912 --> 01:26:50,856
Recovered from the archives of the
Empire but we need the last piece.

995
01:26:50,957 --> 01:26:53,417
And somehow you convinced
the droid to show it to you.

996
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:56,045
You.

997
01:26:57,505 --> 01:26:58,756
A scavenger.

998
01:27:01,091 --> 01:27:03,219
You know I can take whatever I want.

999
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:11,269
You're so lonely.

1000
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:14,771
So afraid to leave.

1001
01:27:18,943 --> 01:27:21,863
At night, desperate to sleep.

1002
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:26,576
You imagine an ocean.

1003
01:27:27,534 --> 01:27:28,828
I see it.

1004
01:27:30,078 --> 01:27:31,831
I see the island.

1005
01:27:36,418 --> 01:27:37,712
And Han Solo.

1006
01:27:40,047 --> 01:27:42,216
You feel like he's the father
you never had.

1007
01:27:42,841 --> 01:27:44,344
He would have disappointed you.

1008
01:27:44,469 --> 01:27:45,761
Get out of my head.

1009
01:27:46,887 --> 01:27:48,430
I know you've seen the map.

1010
01:27:50,015 --> 01:27:51,184
It's in there.

1011
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:53,353
And now you'll give it to me.

1012
01:28:01,985 --> 01:28:04,029
Don't be afraid. I feel it, too.

1013
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:08,993
I'm not giving you anything.

1014
01:28:09,618 --> 01:28:10,703
We'll see.

1015
01:28:50,702 --> 01:28:51,703
You.

1016
01:28:52,787 --> 01:28:53,787
You're afraid.

1017
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:59,752
That you will never be
as strong as Darth Vader.

1018
01:29:08,927 --> 01:29:12,497
The scavenger... resisted you?

1019
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:14,167
She is strong with the Force.

1020
01:29:14,266 --> 01:29:16,043
Untrained, but stronger than she knows.

1021
01:29:16,144 --> 01:29:17,337
And the droid?

1022
01:29:17,436 --> 01:29:20,756
Ren believed it was no longer
valuable to us.

1023
01:29:20,856 --> 01:29:23,484
That the girl was all we needed.

1024
01:29:23,609 --> 01:29:26,054
As a result, the droid has
most likely been returned...

1025
01:29:26,154 --> 01:29:27,279
to the hands of the enemy.

1026
01:29:27,404 --> 01:29:29,097
They may have the map already.

1027
01:29:29,198 --> 01:29:32,935
Then the Resistance must be destroyed
before they get to Skywalker.

1028
01:29:33,034 --> 01:29:34,895
We have their location.

1029
01:29:34,996 --> 01:29:37,622
We tracked their reconnaissance ship
to the Ileenium system.

1030
01:29:38,623 --> 01:29:39,900
Good.

1031
01:29:40,001 --> 01:29:42,862
Then we will crush them once and for all.

1032
01:29:42,962 --> 01:29:44,713
Prepare the weapon.

1033
01:29:45,338 --> 01:29:48,117
Supreme Leader, I can get
the map from the girl.

1034
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:50,011
I just need your guidance.

1035
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:55,725
If what you say about this girl is true...

1036
01:29:56,350 --> 01:30:01,021
Bring her to me.

1037
01:30:14,993 --> 01:30:17,145
You will remove these restraints...

1038
01:30:17,246 --> 01:30:20,332
and leave this cell with the door open.

1039
01:30:24,086 --> 01:30:25,837
What did you say?

1040
01:30:28,757 --> 01:30:33,011
You will remove these restraints
and leave this cell with the door open.

1041
01:30:39,851 --> 01:30:43,564
I'll tighten those restraints,
scavenger scum.

1042
01:30:57,869 --> 01:31:01,916
You will remove these restraints
and leave this cell with the door open.

1043
01:31:05,627 --> 01:31:09,047
I will remove these restraints
and leave the cell with the door open.

1044
01:31:17,974 --> 01:31:21,002
- And you'll drop your weapon.
- And I'll drop my weapon.

1045
01:31:33,738 --> 01:31:34,823
No.

1046
01:31:35,824 --> 01:31:36,826
No.

1047
01:31:38,743 --> 01:31:39,854
Guards!

1048
01:31:42,414 --> 01:31:43,416
Guards!

1049
01:31:48,421 --> 01:31:50,655
Begin charging the weapon.

1050
01:31:50,756 --> 01:31:52,073
Yes, sir.

1051
01:31:52,173 --> 01:31:53,466
Weapon charging.

1052
01:32:12,737 --> 01:32:16,157
The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance
flight confirms Finn's report.

1053
01:32:16,282 --> 01:32:19,618
They've somehow created a hyper-lightspeed
weapon built within the planet itself.

1054
01:32:19,784 --> 01:32:20,728
A laser cannon?

1055
01:32:20,828 --> 01:32:22,662
We're not sure how to describe
a weapon of this scale.

1056
01:32:22,787 --> 01:32:23,773
It's another Death Star.

1057
01:32:23,872 --> 01:32:25,608
I wish that were the case, Major.

1058
01:32:25,707 --> 01:32:26,958
This was the Death Star.

1059
01:32:29,712 --> 01:32:32,213
And this is Starkiller Base.

1060
01:32:32,715 --> 01:32:33,865
So, it's big.

1061
01:32:33,966 --> 01:32:37,052
How is it possible to power
a weapon of that size?

1062
01:32:37,177 --> 01:32:39,305
It uses the power of the sun.

1063
01:32:40,514 --> 01:32:43,876
As the weapon is charged
the sun is drained until it disappears.

1064
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:44,976
Ma'am.

1065
01:32:46,979 --> 01:32:49,564
The First Order, they're charging
the weapon again now.

1066
01:32:50,524 --> 01:32:52,400
Our system is the next target.

1067
01:32:52,525 --> 01:32:53,511
Oh, my.

1068
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:55,095
Without the Republic fleet, we're doomed.

1069
01:32:55,195 --> 01:32:56,972
Okay. How do we blow it up?

1070
01:32:57,073 --> 01:32:59,391
- There's always a way to do that.
- Han's right.

1071
01:32:59,492 --> 01:33:02,603
In order for that amount
of power to be contained...

1072
01:33:02,703 --> 01:33:04,663
that base has to have some
kind of thermal oscillator.

1073
01:33:04,788 --> 01:33:06,957
There is one. Precinct 47.

1074
01:33:07,541 --> 01:33:08,775
Here.

1075
01:33:08,876 --> 01:33:10,836
If we can destroy that oscillator...

1076
01:33:10,962 --> 01:33:13,905
it might destabilize the core
and cripple the weapon.

1077
01:33:14,006 --> 01:33:15,783
- Maybe the planet.
- We'll go in there,

1078
01:33:15,882 --> 01:33:17,217
we'll hit that oscillator
with everything we've got.

1079
01:33:17,342 --> 01:33:20,720
They have defensive shields
that our ships cannot penetrate.

1080
01:33:20,845 --> 01:33:22,247
We disable the shields.

1081
01:33:22,347 --> 01:33:24,015
Kid, you worked there.

1082
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:25,126
What do you got?

1083
01:33:25,225 --> 01:33:26,418
I can do it.

1084
01:33:26,519 --> 01:33:27,770
I like this guy.

1085
01:33:27,895 --> 01:33:29,755
I can disable the shields,
but I have to be there.

1086
01:33:29,854 --> 01:33:31,298
On the planet.

1087
01:33:31,399 --> 01:33:33,024
- We'll get you there.
- Han, how?

1088
01:33:33,775 --> 01:33:35,277
If I told you, you wouldn't like it.

1089
01:33:35,403 --> 01:33:37,262
So we disable the shields...

1090
01:33:37,363 --> 01:33:39,657
we take out the oscillator
and we blow up their big gun.

1091
01:33:39,782 --> 01:33:41,867
All right. Let's go.

1092
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:05,875
Chewie, check that donal capitator.

1093
01:34:05,975 --> 01:34:07,460
Come on. Let's go.

1094
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:09,770
Finn, be careful with those.
They're explosives.

1095
01:34:09,895 --> 01:34:10,938
Now you tell me?

1096
01:34:11,063 --> 01:34:14,274
You know, no matter how much we fought...

1097
01:34:15,693 --> 01:34:18,011
I've always hated watching you leave.

1098
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:19,320
That's why I did it.

1099
01:34:20,573 --> 01:34:22,073
So you'd miss me.

1100
01:34:24,827 --> 01:34:26,619
I did miss you.

1101
01:34:28,079 --> 01:34:29,856
It wasn't all bad, was it?

1102
01:34:29,957 --> 01:34:31,024
Huh?

1103
01:34:31,125 --> 01:34:34,252
Some of it was... good.

1104
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:36,087
Pretty good.

1105
01:34:39,425 --> 01:34:42,302
- Some things never change.
- True.

1106
01:34:42,845 --> 01:34:44,846
You still drive me crazy.

1107
01:34:54,023 --> 01:34:55,940
If you see our son...

1108
01:34:58,444 --> 01:35:00,112
bring him home.

1109
01:35:05,533 --> 01:35:08,186
Sir, sensors triggered in Hangar 718.

1110
01:35:08,287 --> 01:35:09,939
We're searching the area.

1111
01:35:10,038 --> 01:35:12,166
She's just beginning to test her powers.

1112
01:35:12,291 --> 01:35:15,711
The longer it takes to find her
the more dangerous she becomes.

1113
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,409
All sentry droids...

1114
01:35:22,510 --> 01:35:26,037
all sentry droids, resynchronize
to Galactic Standard Time.

1115
01:35:26,137 --> 01:35:28,140
Offset 473.

1116
01:35:30,893 --> 01:35:31,976
How are we getting in?

1117
01:35:32,103 --> 01:35:34,046
Their shields have
a fractional refresh rate.

1118
01:35:34,145 --> 01:35:37,315
Keeps anything traveling slower
than lightspeed from getting through.

1119
01:35:37,899 --> 01:35:39,984
We're making our landing
approach at lightspeed?

1120
01:35:41,444 --> 01:35:42,529
Chewie, get ready.

1121
01:35:43,823 --> 01:35:44,989
And... Now!

1122
01:35:48,911 --> 01:35:50,578
I am pulling up!

1123
01:35:57,293 --> 01:35:58,904
I get any higher...

1124
01:35:59,003 --> 01:36:00,256
they'll see us!

1125
01:36:22,194 --> 01:36:24,572
Sir, she was not found in Hangar 718.

1126
01:36:24,697 --> 01:36:25,765
But all troops are on alert.

1127
01:36:25,864 --> 01:36:27,240
Put every hangar on lockdown.

1128
01:36:27,365 --> 01:36:29,033
She's going to try to steal
a ship to esc...

1129
01:36:31,662 --> 01:36:33,204
Han Solo.

1130
01:36:44,425 --> 01:36:46,118
The flooding tunnel is over that ridge.

1131
01:36:46,217 --> 01:36:47,453
We'll get in that way.

1132
01:36:47,552 --> 01:36:49,454
What was your job
when you were based here?

1133
01:36:49,555 --> 01:36:50,555
Sanitation.

1134
01:36:53,434 --> 01:36:55,127
Sanitation?

1135
01:36:55,226 --> 01:36:56,936
Then how do you know
how to disable the shields?

1136
01:36:57,061 --> 01:36:58,063
I don't.

1137
01:36:58,189 --> 01:36:59,939
I'm just here to get Rey.

1138
01:37:00,064 --> 01:37:03,636
People are counting on us.
The galaxy is counting on us.

1139
01:37:03,735 --> 01:37:05,069
Solo, we'll figure it out.

1140
01:37:06,029 --> 01:37:07,448
We'll use the Force.

1141
01:37:07,573 --> 01:37:09,641
That's not how the Force works.

1142
01:37:11,243 --> 01:37:13,787
Oh, really? You're cold?

1143
01:37:13,953 --> 01:37:14,954
Come on.

1144
01:37:22,378 --> 01:37:23,655
Report.

1145
01:37:23,756 --> 01:37:25,966
Weapon charged in 15 minutes, sir.

1146
01:37:28,426 --> 01:37:29,427
Hey!

1147
01:37:32,597 --> 01:37:34,807
The longer we're here
the less luck we're gonna have.

1148
01:37:34,934 --> 01:37:37,435
- The shields.
- I have an idea about that.

1149
01:37:45,402 --> 01:37:47,846
- You remember me?
- FN-2187.

1150
01:37:47,947 --> 01:37:49,198
Not anymore.

1151
01:37:49,364 --> 01:37:50,682
The name's Finn and I'm in charge.

1152
01:37:50,783 --> 01:37:52,810
I'm in charge now, Phasma. I'm in charge.

1153
01:37:52,909 --> 01:37:54,895
- Bring it down. Bring it down.
- Yeah.

1154
01:37:54,994 --> 01:37:56,121
Follow me.

1155
01:38:09,301 --> 01:38:10,743
Have you checked out the new T-17s?

1156
01:38:10,844 --> 01:38:13,680
The T-17s, as far as I can tell
are a great improvement.

1157
01:38:13,805 --> 01:38:15,640
Yeah. That's what they tell you.

1158
01:38:15,765 --> 01:38:16,975
But believe me, they don't hold up.

1159
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:18,601
- They don't?
- No.

1160
01:38:54,305 --> 01:38:56,039
You want me to blast
that bucket off your head?

1161
01:38:56,140 --> 01:38:57,248
Lower the shields.

1162
01:38:57,349 --> 01:38:59,184
You're making a big mistake.

1163
01:38:59,310 --> 01:39:01,395
Do it.

1164
01:39:05,649 --> 01:39:09,094
Solo, if this works, we're not gonna
have a lot of time to find Rey.

1165
01:39:09,194 --> 01:39:10,570
Don't worry, kid.

1166
01:39:11,363 --> 01:39:12,765
We won't leave here without her.

1167
01:39:14,574 --> 01:39:17,435
You can't be so stupid
as to think this will be easy.

1168
01:39:17,536 --> 01:39:20,104
My troops will storm
this block and kill you all.

1169
01:39:20,204 --> 01:39:22,041
I disagree. What do we do with her?

1170
01:39:22,666 --> 01:39:24,208
Is there a garbage chute?

1171
01:39:24,877 --> 01:39:26,211
Trash compactor?

1172
01:39:27,378 --> 01:39:28,463
Yeah, there is.

1173
01:39:28,796 --> 01:39:30,323
General, their shields are down.

1174
01:39:30,423 --> 01:39:31,992
Thank the Maker!

1175
01:39:32,091 --> 01:39:33,827
Han did it. Send them in.

1176
01:39:33,926 --> 01:39:35,828
Give Poe full authorization for attack.

1177
01:39:35,929 --> 01:39:38,207
Black Leader,
go to sub-lights on your call.

1178
01:39:38,306 --> 01:39:39,291
Roger, base.

1179
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:41,100
Red squad, Blue squad, take my lead.

1180
01:39:41,310 --> 01:39:43,311
Dropping out of lightspeed.

1181
01:39:57,076 --> 01:39:58,577
Almost in range.

1182
01:39:58,743 --> 01:40:01,479
Hit the target dead center.
As many runs as we can get.

1183
01:40:01,579 --> 01:40:03,457
Approaching target.

1184
01:40:07,418 --> 01:40:08,878
Fighters incoming!

1185
01:40:09,755 --> 01:40:11,323
Coming at 28.336.

1186
01:40:11,422 --> 01:40:13,199
Forty-five! Shields up! Shields up!

1187
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:14,967
Dispatch all squadrons.

1188
01:40:15,094 --> 01:40:16,595
Yes, General.

1189
01:40:17,429 --> 01:40:18,430
All right. Let's light it up.

1190
01:40:28,189 --> 01:40:30,259
- Ah, direct hit.
- But no damage!

1191
01:40:30,359 --> 01:40:31,609
Yeah, we gotta keep hitting it.

1192
01:40:31,777 --> 01:40:33,069
Another bombing run.

1193
01:40:33,194 --> 01:40:35,889
Remember, when the sun is gone
that weapon will be ready to fire.

1194
01:40:35,988 --> 01:40:38,574
But as long as there's light,
we got a chance.

1195
01:40:40,284 --> 01:40:41,828
Guys, we got a lot of company!

1196
01:40:48,460 --> 01:40:50,069
We think they may be splitting up.

1197
01:40:50,170 --> 01:40:52,131
Heading to quadrants 4 and 5.

1198
01:40:59,971 --> 01:41:01,957
We'll use the charges
to blow that blast door.

1199
01:41:02,056 --> 01:41:04,792
I'll go in and draw fire,
but I'm gonna need cover.

1200
01:41:04,893 --> 01:41:05,961
You sure you're up for this?

1201
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:07,253
Hell, no.

1202
01:41:07,354 --> 01:41:08,630
I'll go in and try to find Rey.

1203
01:41:08,729 --> 01:41:09,922
The troopers will be on our tail.

1204
01:41:10,023 --> 01:41:12,134
We have to be ready for that.

1205
01:41:12,234 --> 01:41:14,011
There's an access tunnel that leads...

1206
01:41:14,110 --> 01:41:16,637
Why are you doing that? Hmm?
Why are you doing this?

1207
01:41:16,738 --> 01:41:18,073
I'm trying to come up with a plan.

1208
01:41:34,797 --> 01:41:36,367
You all right?

1209
01:41:36,466 --> 01:41:38,077
- Yeah.
- Good.

1210
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:39,744
What happened to you? Did he hurt you?

1211
01:41:39,845 --> 01:41:41,220
Finn, what are you doing here?

1212
01:41:41,345 --> 01:41:43,431
We came back for you.

1213
01:41:44,307 --> 01:41:45,833
What'd he say?

1214
01:41:45,934 --> 01:41:47,310
That it was your idea.

1215
01:41:51,105 --> 01:41:52,190
Thank you.

1216
01:41:56,069 --> 01:41:57,637
How did you get away?

1217
01:41:57,738 --> 01:41:58,764
I can't explain it.

1218
01:41:58,863 --> 01:42:00,932
And you wouldn't believe it.

1219
01:42:01,033 --> 01:42:03,368
Escape now, hug later.

1220
01:42:18,550 --> 01:42:20,092
I got one behind me.

1221
01:42:20,219 --> 01:42:21,595
- You see it?
- Yeah. I'm on it.

1222
01:42:30,229 --> 01:42:32,064
- Burillo's been hit.
- Watch out for ground fire.

1223
01:42:36,984 --> 01:42:38,929
They're in trouble.

1224
01:42:39,029 --> 01:42:40,447
We can't leave.

1225
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:45,226
My friend's got a bag full of explosives.

1226
01:42:45,327 --> 01:42:46,979
Let's use them.

1227
01:42:47,078 --> 01:42:48,454
General, are you seeing this?

1228
01:42:48,579 --> 01:42:49,898
Two more X-wings down.

1229
01:42:49,997 --> 01:42:52,359
That's half our fleet destroyed.

1230
01:42:52,458 --> 01:42:55,112
And their weapon will be fully
charged in ten minutes.

1231
01:42:55,212 --> 01:42:57,338
It would take a miracle to save us now.

1232
01:43:23,782 --> 01:43:24,765
Ah.

1233
01:43:24,865 --> 01:43:27,202
Girl knows her stuff.

1234
01:43:36,168 --> 01:43:38,613
We'll set the charges
against every other column.

1235
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:41,783
You're right. That's a better idea.

1236
01:43:41,882 --> 01:43:43,868
You take the top. I'll go down below.

1237
01:43:43,969 --> 01:43:45,621
Detonator.

1238
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:47,389
We'll meet back here.

1239
01:44:32,809 --> 01:44:33,810
Find them.

1240
01:45:35,579 --> 01:45:36,581
Ben!

1241
01:45:49,344 --> 01:45:50,470
Han Solo.

1242
01:45:51,179 --> 01:45:54,056
I've been waiting for this day
for a long time.

1243
01:46:13,326 --> 01:46:16,829
Take off that mask. You don't need it.

1244
01:46:17,413 --> 01:46:19,291
What do you think you'll see if I do?

1245
01:46:19,416 --> 01:46:21,667
The face of my son.

1246
01:46:43,523 --> 01:46:45,692
Your son is gone.

1247
01:46:46,984 --> 01:46:49,320
He was weak and foolish like his father.

1248
01:46:49,488 --> 01:46:51,238
So I destroyed him.

1249
01:46:53,324 --> 01:46:55,702
That's what Snoke wants you to believe.

1250
01:46:56,953 --> 01:46:58,662
But it's not true.

1251
01:46:59,997 --> 01:47:02,067
My son is alive.

1252
01:47:02,167 --> 01:47:03,609
No.

1253
01:47:03,710 --> 01:47:05,904
The Supreme Leader is wise.

1254
01:47:06,003 --> 01:47:08,739
Snoke is using you for your power.

1255
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:10,634
When he gets what he wants,
he'll crush you.

1256
01:47:15,889 --> 01:47:17,556
You know it's true.

1257
01:47:23,188 --> 01:47:24,171
It's too late.

1258
01:47:24,271 --> 01:47:25,841
No, it's not.

1259
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:27,692
Leave here with me. Come home.

1260
01:47:29,444 --> 01:47:30,862
We miss you.

1261
01:47:39,578 --> 01:47:41,706
I'm being torn apart.

1262
01:47:44,542 --> 01:47:46,711
I want to be free of this pain.

1263
01:47:52,132 --> 01:47:55,386
I know what I have to do, but I don't know
if I have the strength to do it.

1264
01:47:59,306 --> 01:48:00,375
Will you help me?

1265
01:48:00,475 --> 01:48:02,310
Yes. Anything.

1266
01:48:50,609 --> 01:48:53,427
No!

1267
01:49:00,368 --> 01:49:01,619
Thank you.

1268
01:49:09,127 --> 01:49:10,127
No.

1269
01:50:25,453 --> 01:50:28,856
The oscillator's been damaged
but is still functional.

1270
01:50:28,957 --> 01:50:31,458
Admiral, their weapon
will fire in two minutes.

1271
01:50:42,720 --> 01:50:44,180
The Falcon's this way.

1272
01:51:05,076 --> 01:51:06,411
We're not done yet.

1273
01:51:09,581 --> 01:51:11,416
You're a monster.

1274
01:51:11,541 --> 01:51:13,417
It's just us now.

1275
01:51:14,586 --> 01:51:16,087
Han Solo can't save you.

1276
01:51:24,887 --> 01:51:26,680
Rey!

1277
01:51:29,475 --> 01:51:30,961
Rey.

1278
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:32,061
Rey!

1279
01:51:33,896 --> 01:51:35,506
Oh, no. No, no.

1280
01:51:35,606 --> 01:51:36,591
Rey.

1281
01:51:38,818 --> 01:51:40,360
Traitor!

1282
01:51:50,913 --> 01:51:52,457
That lightsaber.

1283
01:51:53,582 --> 01:51:54,609
It belongs to me.

1284
01:51:54,708 --> 01:51:56,360
Come get it.

1285
01:53:44,194 --> 01:53:45,278
We just lost R-1.

1286
01:53:45,904 --> 01:53:47,180
We're overwhelmed.

1287
01:53:47,279 --> 01:53:48,573
What do we do? It isn't working.

1288
01:53:49,323 --> 01:53:51,533
Black Leader, there's a brand
new hole in that oscillator.

1289
01:53:52,577 --> 01:53:54,494
Looks like our friends got in.

1290
01:53:55,121 --> 01:53:56,980
Red Four, Red Six, cover us.

1291
01:53:57,081 --> 01:53:58,233
- I'm on it.
- Roger.

1292
01:53:58,332 --> 01:53:59,859
Everybody else, hit the target hard.

1293
01:53:59,958 --> 01:54:01,002
Give it everything you got.

1294
01:54:13,890 --> 01:54:15,250
I need some help here. I need some help!

1295
01:54:15,350 --> 01:54:16,600
- Coming in!
- Watch out!

1296
01:54:17,810 --> 01:54:19,061
I'm hit!

1297
01:54:24,567 --> 01:54:26,485
All teams, I'm going in.

1298
01:54:26,610 --> 01:54:27,761
Pull up and cover me.

1299
01:54:27,862 --> 01:54:29,613
Copy that, Black Leader. Good luck, Poe.

1300
01:54:35,744 --> 01:54:37,622
Weapon fully charged in 30 seconds.

1301
01:54:39,122 --> 01:54:40,291
Prepare to fire.

1302
01:56:13,384 --> 01:56:14,801
You need a teacher.

1303
01:56:16,679 --> 01:56:18,472
I could show you the ways of the Force.

1304
01:56:21,100 --> 01:56:22,185
The Force?

1305
01:58:10,960 --> 01:58:14,046
- All eyes on that TIE fighter.
- We're losing power rapidly!

1306
01:58:16,423 --> 01:58:18,326
Lieutenant! Get back to your station!

1307
01:58:18,426 --> 01:58:21,720
Just look! We won't survive.
Even Hux is gone.

1308
01:58:21,845 --> 01:58:23,346
Supreme Leader.

1309
01:58:24,222 --> 01:58:26,167
The fuel cells have ruptured.

1310
01:58:26,266 --> 01:58:28,394
The collapse of the planet has begun.

1311
01:58:28,603 --> 01:58:32,648
Leave the base at once
and come to me with Kylo Ren.

1312
01:58:33,733 --> 01:58:35,592
It is time...

1313
01:58:35,693 --> 01:58:38,029
to complete his training.

1314
01:58:40,363 --> 01:58:41,364
Finn!

1315
01:58:42,115 --> 01:58:43,326
Finn.

1316
01:59:32,457 --> 01:59:35,545
- All teams, I got eyes on them.
- Yes!

1317
01:59:58,484 --> 02:00:01,612
Our job's done here. Let's go home.

1318
02:00:16,793 --> 02:00:19,130
Easy, easy. He's hurt.

1319
02:00:19,255 --> 02:00:20,463
We've got a heartbeat.

1320
02:01:22,525 --> 02:01:24,153
R2-D2!

1321
02:01:25,029 --> 02:01:26,029
You've come back.

1322
02:01:29,992 --> 02:01:31,409
You found what?

1323
02:01:31,534 --> 02:01:33,537
How dare you call me that!

1324
02:01:35,914 --> 02:01:37,984
Find Master Luke, how?

1325
02:01:38,083 --> 02:01:39,109
Come, R2.

1326
02:01:39,210 --> 02:01:41,212
We must go tell the others at once!

1327
02:01:42,546 --> 02:01:43,613
General.

1328
02:01:43,713 --> 02:01:45,882
Excuse me, General.

1329
02:01:50,470 --> 02:01:52,972
R2 may contain some much-needed good news.

1330
02:01:53,640 --> 02:01:55,100
Tell me.

1331
02:02:05,485 --> 02:02:06,904
Yeah. All right, buddy. Hold on.

1332
02:02:21,335 --> 02:02:22,962
The map, it is complete.

1333
02:02:23,587 --> 02:02:25,238
Luke.

1334
02:02:25,338 --> 02:02:28,591
Oh, my dear friend, how I've missed you.

1335
02:02:45,568 --> 02:02:47,595
We'll see each other again.

1336
02:02:47,694 --> 02:02:49,613
I believe that.

1337
02:02:57,787 --> 02:02:59,582
Thank you, my friend.

1338
02:03:14,471 --> 02:03:16,306
Rey.

1339
02:03:17,975 --> 02:03:20,770
May the Force be with you.
